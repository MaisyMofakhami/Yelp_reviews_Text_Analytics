Kayla R.,5,"Ordered online from here for my sister in laws engagement! We had a planned party after at my inlaws to celebrate and I was in charge of the cake, so clearly, instead of baking anything, I decided to order from Nothing Bundt Cakes.The process is sooo easy. You can order ahead online. I admit, I waited to the last minute to order, so I ordered late at night for the day before. They have ones you can order with different decorations if you want, depending on what the occasion is. We just got the simple bundtini cakes (which are basically like their version of a cupcake) and did the mix of the flavors and did two dozen, which was perfect! We got red velvet, lemon, chocolate, and some other flavors, too. Literally, they're all sooo good.My husband went in to pick them up and they were ready to go at the time we asked them to be ready for. Simple easy process and I forgot how delicious these are and will definitely be ordering them more in the future!"
Shawna R.,4,"I came in here around noon time, and it was busy surprisingly but I didn't wait long before I was helped. I had a bogo coupon so I was able to get what I want, as they have all the flavors in stock. I grabbed the gluten free lemon raspberry as well as a red velvet. Easy traction, friendly staff."
Gina C.,5,I stopped by the other day to use my BOGO coupon that I got via email which I get them a lot. I also had a GC that a friend gave me for my bday last year. I was greeted right away once I got into the store by Teri. I already knew what I wanted prior to getting there. My favorite Bundtlet flavor is the chocolate chocolate chip.Which they had. I remembered to bring in my lunch card too. Teri rang me up & even offered me silverware which I declined because I was taking them home for later & one was for my friend. She put them in this super cute logo bag of theirs. Transaction was quick & easy. Teri was very nice too! Thank you!
Victoria J.,5,"I absolutely love Nothing Bundt Cakes!! I requested a last minute delivery to my sons work for his birthday and delivery was fast and easy too!  To say he was surprised would be an understatement lol  The cake was so delicious and the icing too! Always a favorite for the raspberry flavor and he loved the decorations on it too, not crazy but just enough, I will definitely be ordering again and will be picking up some of the smaller Bundt's for the holidays! I can't wait!!"
Michelle A.,5,"This year for my birthday, I opted to go with Nothing Bundt cakes.I usually go to Freed's but I recently went and spent a lot there for my daughters sweet 16 and honestly their cake was nothing to write home about.Nothing Bundt Cakes always hits the spot, it's moist, delicious and they put the perfect amount of icing.Bonus if you sign up for their email you get a free bundlet (their mini cakes) typically $5 it's a nice little bonus.The service is fast and friendly.I also go with their confetti cake my daughter usually likes their chocolate chocolate chip and my husband loves their red velvet cake.I definitely recommend them if your looking for a consistently awesome cake for any special occasion.Today I was in a bit of a hurry so I didn't get any photos of the menu."
Paul Y.,5,"The service was excellent. Staff answered any questions we had. Their selection of happy place treats was impressive.  If we are ever in the mainland and there is a Nothing Bundt Cakes, we are stopping by!"
Tina A.,5,"Nothing but Delicious Bundt cakes :) I always come here for almost every occasion for the cakes. They have so many great cake flavors to choose from. Some of my family favorites are: White Chocolate Raspberry, Red Velvet, Strawberries and Cream, and Confetti. These cakes are always super moist and the cream cheese frosting is to die for! The online order service is great too. I  opt for the curbside pick up. You pull right up to the back door of the store and they bring it right out to your car. The Service is always great here at this location even when you go inside. Very organized with a pick up line and an order line. I will continue to come back! Thank you Nothing Bundt cakes for always having the perfect cake for every holiday/occasion that never disappoints!!!"
Helen S.,5,It was really good and they had the order ready and I asked if someone else could pick the cake up and they made it seem less. So yummy. Highly recommend them for your party needs.
Roxanne E.,5,"I ordered a 8 inch cake online for my Husband's birthday! It was easy to choose the design, flavor, message, frosting, and decors! I ordered an 8 inch strawberries and cream birthday cake with lite frosting. It was nice ordering it online because you can view everything versus just ordering over the phone. They had ready for me and it was on time! The cake was super moist and the lite frosting was perfect for us! I will definitely be ordering more cakes from here!"
Row P.,5,"A perfect place to get a Bundt Cake. A wide selection of cakes in different sizes and flavors. I have been ordering from here for many years and each time the Bundt Cakes were made perfect and delicious. Just the right amount of cream cheese frosting and the texture of their cakes are smooth and decadent and it is not crumbly when getting that first bite. That's what I like! Friendly service whenever I stop in, no complaints. The inside is cute well decorated and is also a one-stop shop to get what you need for any occasion. I love how they have Individual Bundtlets to treat yourself for a sweet treat. Stop by a store near you and celebrate the goodness of Nothing Bundt Cakes."
David X.,5,I liked the mini chocolate cake I had. Definitely want to try the lemon next time. Can't wait
Madelyn T.,4,Just want to thank Gaby for her great service and being patient with me. I was being a little indecisive of what flavors to get for my husband's birthday. They are located in the Silverado Plaza off of Eastern and Silverado Ranch with tons of parking. I really like that they are stocked up on a lot of their cake flavors compared to other locations.
Brittany C.,5,"If you are looking for a WOW FACTOR cake, this is your place!Delivery was within the time window they stated and the delivery driver called me upon arrival and was super friendly. I called the store after I ordered the cake to place delivery (as I accidentally ordered pick-up when I meant to order delivery) and the customer service team was helpful and fixed my order, giving me all info I needed.The cakes have so many options and are so pretty and tasty. JUST DO IT and order from here; it will meet or exceed your expectations for the price range. $75 for a two-tiered cake that serves up to 26 or 28 people is not too bad at all in my opinion since sheet cakes other places often go for at least $50 and aren't nearly as pretty as these."
Deborah K.,5,I ordered my friends birthday cake here!They were super friendly and kind to make sure I got the perfect order for my friend.Ambiance is like a normal nothing Bundt cake?? Hahaha nothing out of the ordinary :) will be returning x
Erin S.,5,"I ordered a birthday cake online. Easy pay, easy pick up!!Highly recommend. We got a carrot cake and it was DELICIOUS!!!"
Marites D.,5,"Nothing but wonderful bundt cakes :)My sister surprised me with a beautifully gift wrapped Double Bundtlet Tower of Red Velvet and Snickerdoodle. These bundtlet cakes are super moist, have amazing flavor with perfect cream cheese frosting, and both delightfully yummy! The bakeshop makes 8 inch, 10 inch, and tiered bundt cakes that are available for any special occasion. There's also bundtinis which are smaller bites. I prefer bundtlets because the size and portion is just enough, and it's ridiculously satisfying."
Heidi H.,5,Nothings cuter than mini bundt cakes!!!They taste like heaven & good for any occasion!
Billy L.,5,Love this place. Their bundt cakes are one of a kind out of this world. I wish they are a little less pricey so I can go more often. The service is quick. One weekends they usually have two staff members helping patrons. The service is fast although sometimes they are lines.
Sharon M.,5,"Where do I begin! This place has the best bundt cakes I've ever had. I would say, it's a must visit if you don't have one in your state like Hawaii. It was my second time here and it was not a disappointment. I was able to try a new flavor which was soooo yummy (strawberry).I ordered CHOCOLATE, VANILLA, RED VELVET, LEMON (my favorite), CARROT, STRAWBERRY, and WHITE CHOCOLATE RASPBERRY.They have buntinis (mini), buntlets (great for yourself or to share), and regular cake sizes.All flavors were very delicious. The cake was moist and full of flavor and the frosting was nice and creamy.I would recommend taking some back home as omiyage (gifts for friends and family). They sell the buntinis by the dozen, the bintlets individually or by the dozen. Both can be custom ordered where you can choose your own flavors and you can also make an order online for pick-up. They also sell, insulated bags that can hold up to six buntlets which is perfect for traveling.Ordering the buntinis are great to taste all of the flavors. They also have weekly flavors besides the usual flavors that they offer. The lemon is my ultimate favorite although all are very good!Just be careful when packing them for the plane ride home. Depending on the weather and how hot it is, the frosting may melt down a bit."
Dani B.,3,"The service here is usually really good. However this time we ordered a cake for Mother's Day and we made sure to get extra frosting. What we got does not have extra frosting. I realized once I got to the car so I went back in and brought them my concern and the man upfront took my cake to the back and asked a lady back there if it had extra frosting and I was told the extra frosting is just 4 extra lines. I'm sorry that's so wrong. In the car on the way home I looked up their ""extra frosting"" off their website and I 100% was lied to. I know I didn't pay $3 for 4 extra lines of frosting. I'm very disappointed in the integrity of this store."
Vanessa K.,5,"Jonah and Eli is it Eli were great, thank you for everything! Keep up the great work!"
James D.,5,Can't go wrong with white chocolate raspberry.Ordered online and it was ready for pickup on time.Convenient location. Will be back.
franceska l.,5,"Came here for my free birthday bundtini! I usually have nothing Bundt cakes from gifts or events, so this was the first time I stepped in store. The store is cute, clean, and open! Much bigger than what I thought and I had no idea there were so many flavors! The flavor I chose for my bundtini was the snickdoodle. I've never tried that one before and I loved it! Just like past experiences, the Bundt cake was very moist and flavorful! I love how the icing isn't overbearing either. Now that I know that there's so many options, I'll be coming back to try the others!Customer service was great too! I was greeted from the time I opened the door and in and out in less than 5 minutes after showing my birthday email. Thanks nothing Bundt cakes!"
John C.,5,"The cakes are delicious but today I am writing about the above and beyond friendly customer service I experienced. So friendly and accommodating.  As I waited for my cake to be ready, I overheard several other customers stating the same impression. Sounds like great leadership in this location!"
Elsa R.,5,"Little small store in the corner. It is small, quiet and everything is to go. They have a wide variety of flavors and the Bundt cakes come in different sizes. The flavor of the season is Oreos ! I have tried all do their flavors including a lot of their seasonal flavors and I have not came across one I have not liked. They're all equally moist and full of flavor ! The sizes depends on the amount of people you will be serving cake to or sharing your cake with. They have Bundtini (cupcake) bundtlet (large muffin size) and the two sizes for the cakes. They will also layer them for a larger cake. They have three options for drizzle ( basically the amount of it). The staff is friendly and helpful. I will continue ordering from them as the kids love the cakes !"
Sherri M.,5,I ordered a 2 tear lemon wedding cake.  AMAZING!!!So moist and flavorful.Decorated so lovely!!!Festive for a small wedding I also got a variety of  bundtinis !The store was very organized and helpful.  We used the store on Eastern.I would recommend Nothing Bundt Cakes for any occasion!!!
Wendy F.,5,I don't eat cake but I'll take one from Bundt Cakes any day.My go to for all events. Best and cutest cakes ever!
Ben L.,3,"We had a BOGO free coupon for their mini bundt cakes so we decided to cash in on this deal and get us some mini bundt cakes of deliciousness. This particular location is pretty easy to find as it's located in the same plaza as the Target. Parking isn't an issue. For whatever reason the inside of the shop reminded me of a little girl's tea party. The only thing missing was some stuff animals seated around a small table. There would be Sir Charles Fuzzington (Bear), Ms. Isabella Hornsbee (Rainbow Unicorn), Edward Farsight (Owl), and Penelope Longstep (Giraffe). They table would have those mini bundt cakes and a tea set. Oh and doilies....I'm getting off track.What did we buy and what did we think?Carrot Cake - This wasn't bad. Not overly sweet and you could taste the flavor of carrots but it wasn't overpowering. The cake was tender and the white frosting paired well with the flavor.Chocolate Chocolate Chip - This was alright, but there wasn't alot of chocolate chip in this. The cake was moist and honestly I thought the frosting on this one was a bit too sweet. I ended up eating the cake and leaving most of the white frosting behind.So why did I give it 3 stars? Well my tastes are different from yours and I can't honestly say I'm a fan. I don't see myself going again unless there was another BOGO coupon.https://youtu.be/6QI8162l_qk"
Angela J.,4,"Our favorite cake for birthdays.  Staff is consistently kind and friendly, and with a good variety of cakes on hand accommodates my lack of planning. The cake was moist with just enough frosting,"
Juliana A.,5,"Amazing job with the cakes for the ribbon cutting .I got an update , call the store directly because they use better delivery services . :)"
Sandra L.,5,"What a great review to be able to leave for my 800th review on Yelp!! If you have never been to Nothing Bundt Cakes, run now! It's worth it! They offer a variety of flavors in different sizes. The cake itself is moist and bursting with flavor. They have just enough icing on the top to satisfy. Every time I think I have a favorite flavor picked out, I change my mind. They are all amazing and bursting with flavor. Every location I have been in the employees are all very friendly. Always helpful. The stores are all very clean and well maintained. You can tell Nothing Bundt sets a standard and it's followed. If you are looking for larger cakes for a function, you can order an 8"", 10"" or a tiered cake. You can add decorations to the cake and they can assist you with that. There are options."
Jennifer F.,5,Can never go wrong with NBC. Great tasting Bundts and the place is so organize and clean. They also have a great service. I have been in this location several times and always have good experience. I will be back.
Jessica P.,5,"Happy 'Bundt'Day!! How clever is this quote?? This style cake of cake was my choice for a 1-year old boys birthday celebration. The cake in person was exactly what was featured online: topped with a party hat, a big bow (your choice from 21 colors), two miniature gifts, and signature frosting petals.Pumpkin Spice and everything's nice! So yummy!! This limited flavor is available only from 9/14 to 11/30, so mark your calendars. It's the perfect flavor for this fall weather in Vegas and it was a big hit with all of the adults.The 10"" serves up to 18 people and was a great price at $45! This size worked out very well for our party of 15, with a few slices leftover to enjoy the next day. Pair a slice of the Bundt cake with your favorite cup of coffee and you'll be good to go!Ordering online was EASY! I placed the cake order just 5 days in advance and directly from my mobile phone. I just scrolled and tapped away. This particular location is in the Target shopping center, next to the boba shop. Customer service was fantastic!The 10"" pumpkin spice cake was SO GOOD that I went back after the party and picked up an individual cake called a Bundtlet. So cute, right?? The store, Bundt'ique, offers a really wonderful selection of accessories, too, such as cake stands, coffee mugs, candles, and more!Happy celebrating!!!"
Lola P.,3,"This was my first time coming to this location. It had a nice atmosphere, & I was immediately welcomed. The cakes looked fresh and presentable. Unfortunately, I had to give this location 3 stars due to service I received. I had some questions pertaining to allergens, etc. The employee was not much help , and did not seem like he knew what I was talking about. I think it's important to be able to answer those questions, especially in a food setting. To me that was incredibly unprofessional. I believe his name was Jonah. Thankfully, Eli came and took over my order! He was such a sweetheart. He made sure he answered all my questions and had such a wonderful energy about him!"
Mulltea C.,2,"Yesterday I went in to buy a birthday cake for a friend. Initially the sales person was very friendly and helpful. As I made my decision on what to buy, I had one request that they use a purple bow for the decoration instead of the pink bow that was shown in the photo. The salesperson agreed but also cited many times of being unable to do certain changes due to corporate. I didn't really understand what she was talking about but I paid for my order and waited the time for it to be prepared. When the salesperson brought the order out it was wrapped in plastic and she told me, see, I gave you the purple ribbon. I said thank you, went about my day running errands and when I got home I realized that the decoration that I was given was not the one I had requested, I was given the confetti decoration which is the one I did not want, however the ribbon color was correct. I called to see if I could get it changed but no one answered so I left a message. No one returned my message. I hope the cake is good but I don't really appreciate being lied to and then not communicated with regarding my concerns. It seems corporate only cares that they get their money. Buyers beware. Expensive mistake for me but I will know better next time."
Debbie G.,5,"I love this location for picking up treats for myself, friends, or corporate gifts. They are friendly, prompt and the desserts are always a hit. Sometimes, there are flavors out of stock, so I would plan ahead as much as possible. They have a great punch card plan and offer military discounts as well."
Emma F.,5,Nothing Bundt Cakes always comes through for my kids birthday. Their cakes are very affordable and they are beautiful. Upon walking in I was greeted. It was a little bit busy but the service okay. I honestly forgot to order my daughter's birthday cake so I went online yesterday February 24th 2021 and I put an order in to have it picked up at 12 p.m. on February 25th 2021 and I didn't have any issues it was enough time for them to get it ready! thank you thank you thank you.I am definitely a returning customer can't wait to purchase another decorative cake!
Lisa N.,5,"I love nothing bundt cakes.   It's great for any occasion or just because.  Whether you order online or in person, they always get your order right.  This location specifically is closer to my house and everyone is friendly and helpful.   My favorite flavors are lemon and marble.  They change the flavors every month so I definitely recommend always trying the flavor of the month."
Maggie P.,5,I love ordering from here for occasions as everyone always enjoys the cakes from here. I ordered a couple dozen bundtinis for my boyfriend's birthday and added my own toppers and it turned out great! I delivered these to him at hos workplace and he and his staff really enjoyed these. The workers are very sweet and brought the order out to my car upon pickup!
Karen B.,5,"Best cakes in town. Manager Jori is amazing.  I only use Jori's  Nothing Bundt cakes not only for my birthdays, but for gifts and deliveries to offices that I do business with. Wouldn't change a thing, and I have never been disappointed.  cakes are great and employees are better.  Can't beat the service or the quality, or the management and ownership.They have so many options for cakes, large, medium triple bag of multi flavors, I think there's I can't even count how many sizes she can get and how many flavors. I bake a lot at home, bakery goods, dinners, different nationality foods, but quite frankly you just can't beat nothing Bundt cakes options or quality if you haven't been there you should it'll be worth your while."
Pass T.,5,I don't come here often but when I do they always have very good customer service. Staff is very friendly and helpful. On Friday Nothing Bundt Cakes surprised a lot of parents at Pinecrest Inspirada including myself. They were giving out mini Bundt cakes to parents waiting in their cars in the car loop. Thank you Nothing Bundt Cakes!
Joel P.,5,"Came here the other day for the first time based on a friends recommendation. I've seen this chain around, but was a little apprehensive to try. From my experience lots of places don't bake it correctly and it often comes out dry. Much for the same reason I don't care for turkey. But when it's done right, it's good. Such is the case here. The gals who work here are nice and friendly. They explained that their cakes are nice and moist. I bought an individual snickerdoodle and she wasn't kidding. This was delicious and I'll definitely be back to try other flavors."
Case S.,5,"Got to try this location since it's right next to target and they were offering a free Bundt cake for target team members (very nice of them).Got the red velvet, lemon and snickerdoodle. The lemon could use a little more lemon flavoring. Red velvet was definitely the best one, so good and moist!"
Pat E.,5,"Delicious!  Such a cute ""old fashioned"" style Bakery.  You walk in and they have items for sale for every occasion.   It is defiantly a one stop shopping experience.  Anniversary, Birthday, 1st Birthday, Retirement, Wedding you name it.  Cute cups, wine glasses, napkins they have it all.Most importantly are the baked items, they have personalsize bundt cakes in plastic to go containers which are just delicious and perfect.  You can buy several flavors and not be stuck with a full size one flavor cake.  Nice assortment of flavors red velvet, white chocolate with raspberry, chocolate.....It smells like freshly baked cakes when you walk in which gets you going in the right direction.The counter girl was very sweet and helpful.Stop by if you wanna pick up some delicious cakes for dessert."
Antoine W.,5,You want to impress your family and friends for a small celebratory gathering? You want to give your treat more flair than a sheet cake from the local grocery store? Enter: Nothing Bundt Cakes.Delicious. Moist. Budget-friendly. What more can you ask?My personal favorites: Lemon & Red Velvet.
Vince N.,4,"Thanks to friends, I was introduced to this company that was started in 1997 by Dena Tripp & Debbie Shwetz.  There are now numerous franchised locations nationwide. THE GOODS:Like their name implies, they sell nothing but bundt cakes, available in 8"" and 10"" diameters, double-tiered, cupcake-sized, and a tower gift ""basket"" stacked three high.  Available flavors are classic vanilla, white chocolate raspberry, confetti, carrot, lemon, marble, pecan praline. BUNDT CAKES:I got to try their Red Velvet and Chocolate Chocolate Chip flavors in the ""bundtlet"" size.  Because I'm a cupcake fan, I really liked these as they have a similar texture, flavorful, very moist and perfectly sweetened.  The frosting topping wasn't overly sweet either.  Great job!  I personally wouldn't have chosen two chocolate flavors but they were gifts so I can't be ungrateful, LOL.  OVERALL:I'm really surprised there's no location in Hawaii as bakeries do well here.  I don't have a sweet tooth but will indulge every now and then."
Kara R.,5,My mother loved her birthday cake I picked up for her birthday. It was moist and delicious.
Londa D.,5,"Today was my first visit to Nothing Bundt Cakes and it was well worth the trip Abbey and Eliana had great personalities. I was very pleased with the service and the facility was clean . I will be back, now I know where to come for special occasions."
Elaine P.,5,"The cake was a HUGE hit! When I got there to pick up my order, I realized I ordered the wrong size. They were able to swapped it out on the spot, saved the party!"
Dominique B.,1,"I would legit give them NO stars if I could.It was my niece 10th birthday at her school , and she and her siblings are in the foster care system and I am fighting to get them at some point in the next month. I order online for a dozen minis & pick up was at 9a & I had to be at work by 10a. I had the smallest window to make her day special along side her peers. & for some reason I was waiting inside the bakery for over 26 mins , for a order paid & order days before. &  needless to say I never made it to her school. Thanks for ruining a special moment! & when I asked about management they never got anyone just resumed helping others.You guys are horrible & would never get my money!"
Charlene G.,4,"Who doesn't love cream cheese frosting, frosted on a light and fluffy red velvet cake? Nothing Bundt Cakes are super delicious, fluffy cakes that come in many different flavors (peep my picture). Let's be real, I only buy and eat this stuff because of the cream cheese frosting that is to die for!The best flavor is the red velvet. You can purchase 8 inch and 10 inch cakes for birthdays, graduations, retirement, baby shower, etc parties! For a decorated 8 inch bundt cake, that will run you $32 out the door. I think it's worth every penny because the decor really makes it a meaning gift, plus the cake itself is really good!This location tends to get busy, so how it works is you place your order on the register to the left. From there they build your creation in the back and then when its finished you pick up your sweet creation at the counter to the right. This particular location sells a lot of gifts like wine glasses, special occasions cards (birthday, retirement, etc), make up bags, etc. Just a lot of different items that you can include (check my picture). Customer service wise, this place does a good job in explaining your order and serving it back with a smile. It got busy during the 10 minutes I was there, and the young lady behind the counter handled the line with ease and made sure the orders were taken quickly and out the kitchen on time."
Loya A.,3,I ordered a cake for my sister's birthday over the phone for pick-up the next day.  My niece picked it up and didn't confirm the order.  When we were ready to present it to my sister we unwrapped it and found that it didn't have the birthday package I had requested and paid for.  I was so disappointed. The cake was just plain with a huge hole it it where a beautiful flower should have gone. Luckily my niece had some faux flowers and butterflies on sticks and we were able to decorate the cake beautifully.  I'm only giving it 3 stars because of that experience. Otherwise everyone LOVED the moist and flavorful cake. I called the next day to explain what happen. I was told I would get a refund. The yuh g lady did apologize for what occurred. Once I'm reimbursed for the birthday package I will update my review.
Rachel E.,5,"I actually used these guys as my wedding cake and they were awesome. I always thought getting a fancy wedding cake but then eating it sounded like a waste, so I bought a fancy topper (that you can actually keep), and then got a large bundt cake. Since my wedding was in October we did the seasonal flavor of Pumpkin Spice. We also did assorted bundtinis for those that didn't like pumpkin spice (who are these people though??). When we went in for a tasting they let us try EVERY flavor. I was very impressed with the service. They also let you choose the level of icing you want, but we just went in the middle.Since my wedding we've also ordered bundtinis for work. They're always a hit and you really can't go wrong. They're very accommodating to flavors  and customizations. I would recommend them for a party or wedding any time!"
Catalina J.,5,We ordered a cake for my mother in law and absolutely loved the way it turned out! The flower is so cute! We ordered online for pickup the next day and it was an easy process! The employees were very nice as well. The cake is so moist and the frosting is delicious. We will definitely be returning for other events! Thank you
Melissa B.,5,"Cakes are always delicious, super moist and the frosting is not heavy but perfect and light!"
Ashley B.,5,"I. Am. Obsessed. For the longest time, I have been struggling to find what I think is the best bakery in the Vegas area and although I haven't tried them all yet, as of right now, Nothing Bundt Cakes is the place for me!Nothing Bundt holds true to their name and specializes in bundt cakes. They come in various sizes from minis to large cakes. It might sound boring just having one thing, but when you take one thing and perfect it, it's definitely a recipe for success. Different frosting patterns are available as well as cake toppers and decorations. The selection of flavors is pretty vast and the cakes themselves are incredibly moist. My favorites so far have been raspberry white chocolate and pecan praline, but I've also tried red velvet, marble, and carrot cakes. All are delicious.I also must mention that I am the kind of person who likes to wow, so when a special occasion is going down, I like to get that special someone a sweet treat. I've ordered cakes for work potlucks, birthdays, and just because. The cakes are good for really any occasion and the recipients are always wowed and pleased, so mission accomplished. My family requests their cake all the time now. Even though I live a half hour away, I will continue to go there for the good quality."
Benita C.,4,"Gosh I hate to not give a perfect 5 stars to this company! I have ordered quite a few cakes from them but this was my first time at this location. I usually go to the Sahara location because it's closer to my office but this one is closer to home You can see below what happened on my visit but the store has reached out to me from my emailing them and I feel like their immediate response deserves an upgraded rating.  I am positive that this was an isolated incident and possibly only because of the holiday rush.  Positives: the pick up was set up really well for a busy Christmas Eve day. They had a table outside, one side for ordering and one side for pre orders. We had pre ordered so we walked up, gave our name and in a few minutes our 2 boxes of bundtinis was brought out.  Everyone was wearing masks and seemed to be following safety guidelines (I'm sure tired of Covid!)Anyway the reason for my low rating is that we ordered 1 box if the holiday flavors and one box of regular.  After Christmas Eve dinner we opened the holiday box and there was no chocolate peppermint and my daughter was disappointed so we opened the second box, maybe they just got the labels wrong...nope still no chocolate peppermint. In addition a couple of the cakes looked like they had a bite taken out of them, or maybe the side had been pinched off, like someone wanted a taste.  I do not think that's what happened, but it should not have been sent out looking the way it did. This was not the quality I've come to expect from Nothing Bundt Cakes.  I sent an email to the manager, I will update this review if I get a reply. (Please see my message above regarding contact from the manager)"
Althea G.,5,"DELICIOUS CAKES!  Anything you order will be delicious and presented in a lovely and festive way.  I ordered 24 individual small Bundt cakes for my son's birthday.  Each cake was to include festive toppers.  My order was delivered on time by a nice delivery person.  However, the toppers were not on the cakes I quickly called the store and there response to my complaint shocked me.  They sent an entire new order with the festive toppers delivered to my door within 2 hours.  Of course their cakes are delicious and beautiful.  The customer service is amazing!  I highly recommend this store for any birthday, anniversary or celebratory needs, you will not be disappointed."
Kendra S.,5,"Every time I go here, the has been so helpful & sweet just like their cakes! The flavors of these cakes are made to perfection, no matter which flavor you choose, you will love it! Seriously the best! Also a perfect last minute first idea for ANY occasion and for a GREAT price."
Jay P.,5,"Delicious cake, but very small...I just picked up a cake from Nothing Bundt Cakes. The quality is excellent, but the size is dramatically smaller then before.With the cost of goods going up internationally, I can understand that the profit margin on each cake is shrinking.  So to compensate, it seems that Nothing but Cakes has drastically reduced the size of their cakes to keep up.Please make bigger cakes and charge the customers a few dollars more.  The cakes are totally worth it!"
Bryan D.,1,"First off, I couldn't go in without a mask. What are they Costco or something. Then they tell me I have to call the number to get my already paid for cake. After struggling with the automatic messages the workers were just staring at me through the glass. I finally got fed up and wave at them while watching me struggle. She came out and I told her this was stupid, go aren't doing anything can you just go get me my cake that I already paid for? Why are you making me call a number when I had an appointment to come pick it up? When she brings me my cake, it was wrong. Wrong size, wrong toppings. I had to wait outside in the heat because I was not allowed in because I didn't have a face covering. It's not required. If you are going to open, then open. Stop making this situation worse. Worst experience ever. They all looked that they couldn't care less about it too.Update.... After getting it home I find this. I mean. WTF???????? If you manage this store, expect a call from me tomorrow at 9:00 sharp."
Laura S.,4,Cakes are amazing Customer service not so much But of course we're gonna go back and return because the cakes are unbelievable just wish they would improve on the customer service may be a little bit more training and knowledgeable staff
Brandi B.,5,"One of the best places in Vegas to get your sweet tooth craving...the white chocolate and funfetti are some of my favorites!! Girls are pretty friendly,Lines are usually long The frosting is unreal...You just have to try it !!!"
Dana P.,5,DELICIOUS cakes. Reasonable priced and always prepared for last minute celebrations unlike the awful bakery across the parking lot.  I LOVE Nothing Bundt Cakes.
Kathryn B.,2,"Two strikes and you are out!I ordered a dozen of the mini-bundt cakes in an assortment (5) of flavors, half of which were Carrot Cake.  I ordered these for my husband's 70th birthday, which is a Milestone.I placed the order on August 10, to be picked up on Aug 30.  In other words, they had 20 days' notice.  On August 29th, the day before my husband's milestone birthday, they called to say that they are out of vanilla (vanilla!  Really??) and Carrot Bundt Cakes!How does a bakery run out of vanilla?More importantly, with 20 days notice, how is it that you don't have the Carrot Bundt Cakes I ordered?  Did you sell them to someone else??Carrot Cake is the Birthday Boy's favorite flavor; and half of the cakes were supposed to have been Carrot Cake for him.  The other flavors were for me and guests.  Without Carrot Cake, I had no choice but to cancel the order --   the day before my husband's 70th birthday!  Thanks a whole lot for nothing.  Yet again.Again?  Yes, again.  I had tried to order cakes last December but wasn't able to because, during the holiday season, they suspend the making of traditional flavors in favor of holiday flavors.  Hint:  Traditional flavors are traditional because people like them.  I recently placed another order at Freed's and it was perfect.  From now on, I'll stick to Freed's where I've NEVER had a problem ordering on-line and then picking up exactly what I ordered; ready, paid for, in and out.  I've tried twice in the past eight months to shop at this Nothing Bundt Cakes store only to be unable to do so.  Two strikes and you're out.A few months ago, I placed an on-line order at the NBC store in Huntington Beach, Ca.  The transaction was smooth, flawless; and the cake was delicious.  So my conclusion is that some/many NBC stores are good BUT THIS ONE ON EASTERN IN HENDERSON SUCKS."
Caligirl F.,4,"I am a huge fan of this place.  Their cakes are always sooooo good, tasty, moist, and scrumptious!!!  The red velvet cake is to die for and the chocolate chips in the cake is absolutely amazing!  I get the small cake and could easily eat the whole cake in 2 days but I have been good.  I always get the extra icing cuz what they put on there is usually not enough for my greedy appetite.  I ordered online to pick up after work and the service I receive is always top notch.  I am always greeted the moment I walk in the door.  They have so much little cute unique stuff in there, you can end up spending alot more than you really expected to. I am a forever customer as long as the quality of the cake and customer service remains the same."
Suzzie F.,1,"Usually like this location but today I was waiting in line and it was my turn and a party of 5 or so people came in and the employee with bleach blonde hair completely ignored me and let the party of 5 cut in front of me??? I tried saying ""I was in like before them"" and she ignored me. I walked out. That was so RUDE of everyone inside the store. Super annoyed and disappointed because this is my closest store."
Marina H.,5,"I love the red velvet flavored cakes here.. they are so moist. Their chocolate chocolate chip flavor is second on the list If you sign up for email alerts, they will send you a free bundtlet for your birthday. Who wouldn't want that??"
Justin C.,5,How can you not love this place?!? We have been coming here for years. We stopped in after lunch and tried a sample of the Confetti bundt cake. The samples they give out are perfect because they put just the right amount of cream cheese frosting on the top. We looked in the display case and decided on the white chocolate raspberry and a pecan praline bundlet. Just the right sauce of goodness after any meal! Very pleasant employees and the best bundlets in Vegas.
Susan R.,5,This is a guilty guilty pleasure that must not be overlooked. Bunds Cakes takes these cakes to a whole new level so good that these melt in your mouth. The strawberry with there fantastic frosting is so worth the extra work out in the gym.The store that they have on Eastern is cute and tucked away with tables outside and a tarp where you could enjoy your bundt cake if you could not wait. Their store is so eclectic that it is a must browse.
Marie T.,5,"Just recently, I've made a few stops here to pick up some mini bundts for different occasions. Store is cute with lots of other goodies for purchase like cards, mugs, frames, etc. I've had to wait a bit for my turn to be helped, but I was assured that it would be worth the wait. The employees have been sweet and friendly. Of course the main attraction are the bundts. They offer different flavors like red velvet, chocolate chocolate chip, lemon, carrot and much more. I think I may have stopped in about 4 times to get cakes for others, but had never gotten anything for myself. Finally today, as part of my anniversary gift, my bf gave me the chocolate chocolate chip mini bundt. OMG!! I was missing out on all the times I bought for everyone else!! The cake was super duper moist and soft. And it wasn't overly sweet like I thought it would be. It was just the right amount of sweetness. And I like that it's not covered in frosting because I'm not a fan of frosting. I'm looking forward to trying more flavors in the future."
Louie S.,5,"Phase two reopening-Governor mask mandate:Mask required, social distancing measures enforced. Four people max in the store at a time. Staff wears masks and gloves. Quick visit. Was waiting for a patron to come out as my two daughters were with me. Store employee opened door for me as I use a walker and invited us in. Told her what I was looking for which were some small treats for my little girls and she walked us over to the display and recommended items on the bottom row. My daughters chose chocolate chip and were pleased by the taste. A bit pricey at $4.50 but definitely worth the cost as everything is well made, decorated, and packaged.Transaction was fast and easy, along with minimal contact on hand off. The young lady was very cordial. Will definitely visit again in the future."
Angela C.,5,"What's better than cake with the whole center filled with frosting? Nothing bundt cake is amazing. I've had numerous flavors and they're consistently flavorful, moist and delicious! I have ordered the full size bundt, bundtlets and buntinis. If you want the perfect cake, theirs are perfect. Inside the store they usually have fresh samples out. You can order online, in store or over the phone. The staff are always friendly and the store is cute inside with all kinds of gifts to buy or add to the cakes. Although I like all the flavors my favorites are the red velvet and carrot. I love how there's frosting in every bite and never too much or too little."
Bernice P.,5,"This was my first time ordering from here after hearing such great reviews and let me tell you I was impressed! I wanted a cute cake for my Mom's birthday and loovved the presentation of it!! These cakes are beautifully decorated and taste just as good! At the moment you can order by calling them or placing an order online. Once you arrive at the store, just give them a call letting them know you're there as they are presently not allowing customers inside. The lady who delivered my cake was very friendly and professional. I ordered the carrot cake which was very delicious and I would like to try some of their other flavors next time. Will definitely be ordering from here for a future special occasion!"
Jen N.,5,"Okay this place is just ridiculously amazing. We have come in for individual sized bundt cakes on two occasions now. Such a treat. These are the most moist cakes that I have ever had. They always have samples, and they are always super friendly. Besides cakes, they have all sorts of gifts to purchase. Whenever I want to treat myself to a tasty dessert, this is the place to go. Always fresh, always full of flavor. The lemon is my favorite. Just yummy."
Mary S.,5,I mean how can you not love this place. I've been here 1 million times and never have received anything that was dry or not tasty. I absolutely love all the flavors. I love to order their mini cakes and get the assorted packs. I wish I could pick my favorite flavor I simply can't. I actually got a bonus this time they gave me a free cake. I love this place too because you can literally drop in and grab whatever you need and don't have to worry about pre-ordering. I'm sure if you need a lot or something Specific I would order just in case. But I've never had any issues. But you know how newtons law works so if you have your heart set on some thing call them first.
Jonathan P.,5,"There is a different level when it comes to describing Nothing Bundt Cakes. Omgdefrickenlish..... Thats right peeps I said it..... If you dont know this treasure, Do try them... I Love getting the dozen of the minis and devouring them in 2 bites..... I dont want to rush..... So am a fan of the Chocalate with Chips and Lemon, fine  Red Velvet , Vanilla Rasberry ok is there one that I am not a fan of.... nope....I could do them on a daily, but naturally would be a balloon myself as I never stop at 1 and rarely 2.....Well ...... I am grown and mature now.... :)"
Anastasia S.,5,"Staff is amazing very attentive, quick, polite and to the point! the cakes are always fresh and delicious I love this place you guys rock!!! always worth a wait on a holiday! or any day!! Especially during a pandemic they make sure everything is clean and people are spaced out and have masks onyou guys kick a$$! Sesai, Jori, Kass, Drew, Jonathan, Courtney and the rest of the staff Are awesome!!"
Eric S.,4,What isn't to like? Their cakes with thick cream cheese based frosting are always moist and delicious.  They have mini cakes as well so you can get a taste without being tempted to overeat. They have even smaller ones(cupcake size) called bundtinis of which you can buy a variety of 12 for $20.00.  they have gift packages and a catering section.  They were out of nearly everything when we arrived although they did find the red velvet bundtlet we wanted.
Jordan B.,4,"Went to my cousin's baby shower and she had a bunch of these little cakes I've never heard of. She told me to take a few home and try them out. They were so good that me and my family ate them all. Did some research and it's in my area. Will be stopping by tomorrow to pick some up. Great portion, really soft and not too sweet."
Donna M.,5,"I've never been disappointed and have order on line several times, in Manhattan Beach, CA; however, now that we've moved to Henderson, I've ordered my honey a birthday cake & expect It to be wonderful  I do agree with the post that said they should have a designated person helping with the online orders !"
Brittany H.,3,"My collective experience wasn't the best at this location; two stars are for the actual cakes, but the cakes would earn that from me at pretty much any properly performing brand location. I had to call more than once about my online order and twice was put on hold so long (+5 mins) the phone disconnected. The first time I didn't care because the pickup date was far enough in the future I just handled it another time. The second time it was about an hour of my pickup time and when I called back, the representative wanted to put me on hold again and would ""get to me when she can"". So maybe get disconnected again?? Not great. When I arrived for pickup, the store was frantic and poorly signed. They had a lot of problems looking up my order every time I called and a problem finding it when I was there for pickup. Also not great.What is great are the cakes, and they earn the bulk of this review. Maybe I'll try the other location off Rainbow next time and hope for better results.*response to management's comment: I did call the bakery directly every time.*"
Monica D.,1,"I ordered 2 dozen of the cupcakes. When I got there I asked if they would wrap them individually. I was taking the cupcakes to the office, and due to Covid, I wanted them wrapped.I asked the person at the front counter if they would be wrapped. He gone to the back to ask the manager. The person from the front counter came back and started the office manager said they could not. That they would have to ask corporate if they could do that or not. I had to cancel the 2 dozen order and left."
Dominique D.,5,Adele and Alleluia (I know I'm butchering their names) were the sweetest young ladies ever. They were such a breath of fresh air on a Friday evening right before closing time you would have thought this was the beginning of their shift. They worked as a team to get the customers in and out of the store So that the other guest waiting outside were able to come in. I frequent Nothing Bundt Cakes often however I'm not from the area. But If I were this would definitely be my go to location. A genuine smile and warm heart goes a long way. The cakes are always bomb at any Nothing Bundt Cake. Every flavor is amazing. I'm not a fan of their Red Velvet. Ps. ALWAYS TRY THEIR SEASONAL CAKE. Always! Thank me later.
Danbee T.,5,"i absolutely love this spot. i have been coming over here for years to enjoy their amazing bundt cakes for all occasions. honestly, this brand bakery has become so popular over the years, but service never seems to decline with every order i place. i order cakes here for special occasions, get togethers with family and friends, and random days to sweeten people's lives. i absolutely love all their flavors, but i recommend the confetti and double chocolate because of my preferences. my best friends love the red velvet flavor. the most enriching thing about the cakes here is the balance of flavors and soft, fluffy texture of the spongey cake. you can't go wrong with any flavor here in reality. my best friends and i order for our birthdays and when the employees don't come through in some regard with the correct order (which tends to be rare), the customer service dept. (manager) actually take the time to make you feel appreciated and correct the consumer experience. i can say this is definitely one of my favorite spots in the henderson valley! thank you nothing bundt cakes for your dedication to quality baking, quality customer service, & outstanding consumer experiences!"
Reyna O.,1,"Due to the time crunch I was on, I placed a curbside pickup order at 10am. I waited in my car for 20 minutes. I texted the curbside number 3 times, called the store 3 times, and ended up waiting in line for another 15 minutes before just cutting through into the store to let them know i was waiting outside for 20 minutes. I was not dressed anywhere near presentable because I had no intention of going inside. Managed to pick up my groceries and pharmacy order through curbside. So waiting in line was embarrassing. When I finally gave them my information I waited even longer because they had no idea where my orders were. This was absolutely ridiculous. This is the 2nd time I have ordered online, selected curbside pickup, and have been FAILED. Don't offer curbside if you can not fulfill it. I have never had any issue ordering curbside from anywhere else. Other restaurants, stores, and even pharmacies have all been successful."
Lisa S.,1,"I placed a Curbside pickup and sat in my car for 15 min. Called them numerous times and no one would pick up the phone. Did not expect to have to get out of the car. Hence ""curbside pickup"" . I was not dressed for the weather. Had to stand outside in line freezing cold. Once I got inside I asked them about curbside pick up and all they can say is ""oh sorry this is curbside pick up right now"".  Horrible service and super disappointed. They will not be receiving my business nor my company's business ever again. Which is really sad as I normally order cakes for all my customers."
Michelle D.,5,"We all know what to expect when it comes to Nothing Bundt Cakes...Moist, delicious cakes that everyone can agree on!However...This review is about Jori and her team and their amazing and attentive customer service I received this past weekend. She went above and beyond when I made a mistake (I'll spare you the details,) and saved a bridal shower! She was quick to assist and find a resolution all while being completely graceful and kind! I truly appreciate it, thank you!"
Bethany E.,4,I'm kicking myself for not stopping here sooner!  I offered to bring a dessert to enjoy the Knights playoff game.  Searching online I found they made one specifically for them.  Awesome! I stopped in early one morning as they were opening.  The ladies here were friendly and helpful.  I could tell one of the girls was fairly new as she had to ask questions to another associate.  Unfortunately she gave me a different flavor than I had asked for.  It was already too late to do anything about it since I noticed when I was walking into our friends house.  As for the cake itself? OMG.  Unbelievably moist and decadent!  The frosting was perfectly sweet.  The lemon cake in which we received was very tasty so it was a happy accident.  I wouldn't mind having that again.  They do display mini bundtlets of various flavors in their cases.  After browsing the treats they also offer cute gifts and cake accessories for all occasions.  Thanks for an amazing dessert.  I'm looking forward to a return visit for more!
Charlene C.,5,"Always YUMMMM and never disappoints!! Plus the staff is always so nice.2 tips: sign up for the rewards program and get notifications of upcoming monthly flavors, buy one get one specials and birthday benefits  AND for those who's inner sweet tooth gets out quite a bit, get the punch card - just be mindful of the expiration date."
Becky A.,5,Always super delicious has amazing service and staff genuinely lovecoming here and ordering for special occasions or birthdays!
Erica I.,5,Ordered online and pickup was ready at scheduled pickup time! I have ordered from this location before and have always had a great experience. My favorite flavors are lemon and strawberries & cream.
Ashley T.,5,"Their staff is phenomenal. Whenever I come in, they're so friendly, helpful and efficient."
Yvette G.,5,"I found out about Nothing Bundt Cakes at Bridal Spectacular in 2014 and have been a customer since. I love bundtinis! I have tried most of the flavors  and you can't go wrong with any. My favorite is red velvet with chocolate chips inside. I usually order bundtinis inside the store, but found out I can do it online and quickly pickup instead of waiting between 15 to 20 minutes for a custom box (totally worth the wait for these yummy bites though!). There is a limited selection of flavors for the bundtlets and cakes in the display case. Delivery is also an option. 9/1 I picked up a custom dozen with a message card held on the edge of the box by a tiny wooden clothes pin and there was a flavor sticker inside the box. Service was friendly and quick. There were samples of the current seasonal flavor (blueberry bliss) in store. Bundtinis were moist, fluffy, and flavorful as always!"
David E.,4,"I love their cakes, I feel like you can't really go wrong with any of their flavors. The service was ok, it was pretty busy"
Jessica M.,5,I ordered the vanilla cake for my moms birthday and my entire family loved it! My mom says it's one of the best cakes she's ever had! Also they have really cool different colored candles!!
Steven H.,5,"I can't believe I haven't written a review for here yet! We all have our guilty little pleasures, and Nothing Bundt Cakes is mine! The cakes are just perfect. Moist, soft, delicious and just the right sweetness. The thick frosting is also perfectly sweet. I'm glad they aren't too close by my house :)They have several different sizes for any occasion. Bundtinis are great for an office or work party, the bundlets are great for one (or to share if you must), and then they have full size cakes for birthdays or special occasions. My favorite flavors are red velvet, chocolate chocolate chip and lemon. They also offer a flavor of the month which is currently confetti.  Next time you need you have a cake craving or birthday stop in NBC, you won't be disappointed."
mvc j.,5,"Nothing Bundt Cakes is just terrific!  I have been a customer for nearly 20 years, and their quality, service and consistent excellence of their cakes has been truly remarkable and spectacular."
Kiley P.,1,This store does not answer the phone to order a cake for my GRANDMOTHERS 80th BIRTHDAY. Since I couldn't get ahold of anyone on the phone I ordered the cake online 10 DAYS IN ADVANCE.  When I go to pick up the cake they let me know that they don't have the carrot cake I ordered over a week ago and that it was a first come first serve basis. Nobody called me to let me know like they were supposed to. Very disappointed because this was her favorite cake and that's why we came to this location. My grandma was a little sad as she was looking forward to her favorite cake in her 80th birthday. You guys really dropped the ball for us on this one and nobody in the store seemed to care. Nothing was offered to try to accommodate the mistake this store made. Very disappointed.
Ayesha A.,5,"I have been a fan of nothing bundt cakes since I was in high school :)The cakes are soft, decadent, and artistic. The frosting is made out of cream cheese and butter, and they have an abundance amount of flavors. I always get these cakes for myself or for others. In addition, they're cakes are NOT too-overbearingly sweet. The only sweet taste really comes from the frosting.My favorite flavors :)-White chocolate raspberry, MUST GETTTTT-Carrot cake-LemonPrices:-Miniature bundt cakes $3.99-A dozen minature bundt cakes: $45-8"" non-decorated frosted bundt cake (feeds 8-10 people): $21-8"" decorated frosted bundt cake (feeds 8-10 people): $21-10"" non-decorated frosted bundt cake (feeds 18-20 people): $31-10"" decorated frosted bundt cake (feeds 18-20 people): $42-honestly these cakes are deletctable & i hope to have my wedding cake from here one day :)"
Ginny Q.,5,"This is perfect place to go if you want some different from cakes or cupcakes. The staff is friendly and efficient, I was in and out within 5-10 minutes. Plus the bundt cakes are delicious!"
Shelley V.,5,I stop in here every now and then to satisfy my sweet tooth. I usually pick up two bundtlet cakes in different flavors. The staff is always friendly and helpful. The cakes have good flavor and are always moist. I have also stopped in to get bundtinis for birthday celebrations. They also do special occasion bundt cakes and towers and have birthday and special occasion decorations.
Darlyn C.,5,"Stopped in as I've never tried a bundt cake. I reserved a trampoline party for my daughter and they sell bundt cakes as a cake option for bday parties.  I figured I would stop at a store and purchase a mini bundt cake to sample . I purchased  the strawberries and cream for my daughter to try. The frosting was too sweet for us but the cake itself was moist, I was expecting it to be dry. I Look forward to trying the other flavors even if my daughter didn't want a bundt cake for her bday party."
Brunetti T.,5,"Besides the fact that these guys have amazingly moist and delicious cakes, their service was quick and professional. Their place was clean and organized. Their staff was knowledgeable and helpful in picking out flavors. We totally recommend giving them a try."
Goalkeeper G.,5,"I may or may not share my mini bundts with my family. Ok, I don't....MINE! Lol ha ha ha!"
Anthony S.,5,"Great customer service and great cakes! I come here alot of birthday cakes or just to get my sweet tooth craving! I really love the strawberry, vanilla and confetti cake! My favorite cake to get is the marble! Pricing is very reasonable! You will not be disappointed"
Priscilla C.,1,"I am very disappointed with this place. I usually order and pick it up and it's been fine but this time I placed an order over the phone to have it delivered to my wedding reception. They told me that they usually run about 30 minutes late so I scheduled delivery accordingly. I told them it was for a wedding and what time it was at. They attempted to deliver my order 1hr 30 minutes earlier (while I was getting married) than they told me and as a result my delivery was returned back to the store because nobody was there to receive it at that time. When I called back to tell them that nobody said they would deliver this early, they told me there was nothing they could do and that I had to go pick up the cake myself. I had to go pick up the cake myself after my wedding ceremony and the cake was warm. They just had it sitting there. They didn't offer to return my delivery fee or anything. Not good customer service."
Mari G.,5,"While I am not a fan of cake in general, these cakes are moist, flavorful, and frosted just right and I can never say no to a slice. Their bakery sticks to what they know and they do it well. It's the same cakes in a few sizes but whether it's the large or a bundlet, they are always consistent in quality. This time around I bought the marble, chocolate chocolate, strawberries and cream, and chocolate turtle. I usually get the chocolate chocolate one, but this time since I had a coupon I decided to sample their different flavors. The plainest was the marble, it was just like white frosted cake. Their chocolate chocolate is just the right amount of chocolate and like I previously mentioned, my usual. Their seasonal chocolate turtle tasted just the same as their chocolate chocolate, but it had caramel. My second favorite, the strawberries and cream, has a strong strawberry flavor you cannot mistake, as opposed to most cakes I have had of the same flavor elsewhere. Their prices are good and I have yet to dislike any of their flavors. Definitely worth a try whether or not you are a fan of cake."
Matthew L.,5,Never would've guessed that these little bundlets pack so much into a small container. They are somehow light and fluffy yet rich at the same time. Stamp cards are available and service is always very friendly!
Johnny C.,2,Valentine's day super slow moving lines.  They had one cashier working and one guy running the take out orders in the back.  They just need better planning.
Katya A.,5,"Simply delicious!  The staff is friendly and the cakes are to die for!!!Very easy to order online, or go the store in person.  They always have a nice selection.  YUM!!!"
Sandra C.,5,"Great cake, for birthdays or just because . My preferred store is in west sahara ... not many people and the staff is always friendly"
Victoria P.,5,"These cakes are so delicious! The employees are really friendly, especially the young lady that helped me out. She did everything in her effort to make sure I was happy. I bought 2 bundtlets for $total 3.99 since I had a coupon which was even more amazing. Will be coming back!"
Kodybear Z.,5,Best. Thank you Rain. You expedited our order for 100 bundlets without any errors and on time.I'm glad we opened a corporate account with you.Definitely ordering again.Thank you
Christy A.,5,Our favorite place for red velvet cake!!! The cake is perfect! Not too sweet and you can finish the cake without feeling too heavy! I love it!
eran d.,5,My daughter delivered my grandson at southern hills hospital and for her celebratory meal they had Everything Bundt Cakes white chocolate raspberry. This is truly the most moist and delicious cake I have eaten since I've come to Vegas!!! Truly a treat not to be missed!!! Highly recommended!!!
Thomas S.,5,"TLDR: samples available, flavors run out at end of day, advanced orders welcomedA friendly visit to the local NBC came about after having some boba next door. Who doesn't love moist, delicious cake? We decided to venture in and grab some samples of the flavor of the day. The store is beautifully organized with everything to help order your cake or non-food items to accompany the cake. We wanted to purchase a cake, but not a large whole cake. We noticed they sold ""bundtlets"" at a small portion for $4.50. Well this was right up our alley! We took home a couple of available flavors that remained, but we will have to come back to try the special seasonal flavors. If you're looking for a year-round flavor, try birthday cake. You will definitely not be disappointed."
Sabrina G.,4,"Ordered online, all went smooth. Went to pick up and it took 10 mins before anyone came up to the front where I and two others were waiting. The person in front was there longer than I was.Other than the wait to pick up my order, I had no other issues."
Michelle S.,5,"We've been fans of Nothing Bundt Cakes shortly after moving to Vegas in 2005 when customers at the restaurant I served in would bring them in for their celebrations and would gush about how amazing they were. That's when the company was just a local secret. Now they're a successful national franchise. And anyone who has tried them knows why. Never have I been disappointed with their product. They're consistent and mouthwateringly delicious, quality unwavering. I've never received bad customer service; they're polite and efficient. The only difference between then and now is the pretty branding they've packaged their stores and boxes with. I hope nothing ever changes."
Ardiene Kaye D.,5,"It's both a blessing and a curse to have this store walking distance to my house. It has come to the point that I'm so obsessed with their little bunt cakes that I had to compromise with myself. One every two weeks to satisfy my craving and to keep myself under control. Their cakes are so soft, they melt right in your palettes. The frosting is sweet, a little too sweet if you eat a lot but it definitely compliments the simple but ohhh so delicious tasting cake. A great cake for all occasions! Available flavors: Chocolate-Chocolate Chip, White-White Chocolate, White Chocolate Raspberry, Red Velvet, Lemon, Marble, Pecan Praline, Cinnamon Swirl, Carrot. Currently, they have a coupon code: buy one, get one free (01/16/17-01/21/17)."
Kristi W.,5,"I love this place because of the bundtlets! The large cakes are beautiful, but when we have a birthday party we like to give our guests the option of a variety of flavors! Plus we split them in half and get to taste more flavors! Yesterday I tried the pecan praline and it was so good! The bundtlets also make good birthday tokens for your friends and are an excellent way to say thank you to someone! My favorite flavors are the white chocolate raspberry and the lemon. If you buy 10 bundtlets you earn a free one if you use your stamp card!"
Carla R.,4,On 4/13/2019 I went to this store to order Bundtlet cakes for our daughters wedding reception.
Michelle G.,5,"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     49/100YES! I finally made it in time (before the coupon expires) to pick up my free birthday bundlet! The past couple of years I've been on the mailing list, and I missed it. This is one birthday freebie you want to sign up for. No purchase necessary. The girls working there are friendly and helpful. I was waiting behind a couple of people (who were still ordering) and I was still in and out of there within 5 minutes. I have only been to the shop once, but have tasted their bundt cakes a few times through friends. I've tried their carrot cake and lemon bundlets. All were soft, delicious and better than most cakes I've had, unless it's my cousin's. This time I decided to try the White Chocolate Raspberry. It was a white chocolate cake, with raspberry swirl and cream cheese frosting. It was soft, moist and delicious, but I prefer the carrot and lemon. I think it's just me, but I couldn't tell the difference between this and yellow cake. I couldn't taste the white chocolate. Other than that they all have the right amount of sweetness. Not to sweet and perfect for me, I can only have so much sugar at a time. They have a couple of different sizes as well. The bundlet is a good size and can be shared or you can save half for later in it's cute container. I will definitely be back to try the other flavors. Looking forward to trying the Chocolate Turtle & Lemon Raspberry. I would've tried those but it wasn't available. TIP: It's a small shop located in the Target shopping center on Eastern near St. Rose. Located right next to No.1 Boba."
Kamika T.,5,I am addicted to this place! I had my first slice at a birthday party a few weeks ago and since then I have been on a mission to find these cakes near my home. The mini bundt cakes are perfect for satisfying my sweet tooth but I plan on getting a couple full size cakes for the holidays coming up. The white chocolate raspberry is my absolute favorite followed by the chocolate chocolate chip cake. My daughter even asked me can we have a Nothing bundt cake for her birthday in may and of course I'm all for it lol
Jessica G.,5,"I always want a bundt cake from here, but I'll literally get diabetes if I can't stay away.  They have fee samples so you can taste how amazing they are, and it's super affordable for the quality and taste.  The staff is so friendly, specifically Bianca.  She helped husband with a cake right before closing, he wasn't going to make it, so she saved it and has it ready for him 10 min after.  She didn't need to do that, but the fact that she was willing to go above and beyond to help out a guest? THAT is what I call amazing customer service.  I will always go to this store not just because of the delicious pastries, but I always know I'll be treated with the utmost care from the staff.  Thank you Bianca!"
April T.,1,Do not go to this place during the holidays not only as the staff rude and they are understaffed but everyone in there is just completely rude.
Kim I.,3,"My family and I have been ordering from Nothing Bundt Cakes for the past 3 years. The cake quality has not changed - always moist, flavorful, and delicious. However, the quality of service has decreased. My most recent transaction was for the graduation theme tiered caked. When I called to make an order, they asked to call back tomorrow morning because there was ""a line out the door."" My personalized note was a mess. They misspelled every other word of my degree. Really? They typed ""Bacholor of Sience in Bological Siences Class of 2019."""
Angel K.,5,"I love NBC! They're definitely my favorite cake in Vegas. The shop is cute, the young gentlemen who's helped me a couple of times is very nice, and the price is right.They sell bundt cakes in a variety of sizes and flavors. They have seasonal flavors and you can get the cakes decorated for special occasions.All of the flavors I've tried are good but my absolute favorite is white chocolate raspberry. It's so good! My favorite thing to get is the dozen bunditinis with a variety of their flavors. It's like $20 bucks after tax which is a lot better than $40&up for a dozen cupcakes anywhere else. Frankly these are better than cupcakes in Vegas too. They're so moist and the cream cheese frosting is addicting.I love their consistency, friendly staff, their branding, and the whole experience of ordering and eating their products."
Shirley B.,4,"Gotta love Yelp app check ins!  I totally forgot about Bundtlets until I saw my friend checking in on their Yelp apps and having one. (Ahem Molly T. that's you).  So while I was in the area getting my Boba tea fix, I popped on in just to take a peek and see what they had.Usually I just get customized bundt cakes and have them delivered as little ""thank you"" gifts for companies I have dealt with or given as gifts for special occasions. Majority of the time I did my ordering online. So it has been awhile since I stepped foot in this store.So now not only do they have the 8 & 10"" sized bundt cakes ready to go, there are Bundtinis which are bite sized ones sold by the dozen and Bundtlets which are slightly larger in both height and diameter than a cupcake. Two people can easily share them. The prices are pretty reasonable also, just $3.99.Took a little sample of the turtle/caramel bundt cake they had pieces of and that was it. I had to have one!They had a nice selection of flavors represented of the Bundtlets just tempting me to bring home.  Pecan Praline, Lemon, Cinnamon Swirl, Red Velvet, White Chocolate,  and the one I ended up getting White Chocolate Raspberry! The place was busy but wait time was pretty short. When it came to our turn the young lady was all smiles and eager to help us. Picked and paid for my sweet treat and off I went to the park did my run, came home and had my bundt! (well I shared mine w/Mr. B!)The cake I had was pretty moist, white chocolate flavor was subtle and the cream cheese frosting was just slightly hardened like they just had put it on that hour. It had just the right amount of sweetness. Overall it was pretty good!  I would have it again. And since they come nicely packaged up, they make cute little unique gifts to give out as well."
Ruiza A.,5,"Best Bundt cakes ever!! After having lunch at the close by in-n-out, we needed a cake for the bday celebrant tonight. We weren't locals so I of course turned to my trusted yelp iPhone app for guidance. There were several bakeries around the area with their signs taunting us to come in, but we just straight up ignored it and followed the app. So glad we did!!I love desserts that have just the right amount of sweetness. This one definitely takes the cake! I was worried that it was gonna be too sweet and maybe dry but their tasters proved me wrong--we all got won over. I didn't even hesitate to scoop up an 8'inch chocolate bundt cake $18! (And a small red velvet bundt for me to go! Hehe! Didn't see the pineapple upside down one which I wanted but ill try that next time) They have different kinds of candles and decorations available, as well as ready to pick up cakes to go. They even have little scrapbooks for bdays/bachelorette events! I definitely urge you to drop by in this delicious smelling store if you are in need of a cake for a special occasion in Vegas."
Mike A.,1,"Placed an order for my Mother's 79th Birthday, order was canceled without explanation and my money was never refunded. No one answers the phone or returns calls.  Paid $65.25 for nothing, unable to get a refund. Terrible customer service at this location.My online Order #3577166."
Michaela S.,5,"Delicious! We ordered the chocolate raspberry cake for my sons birthday. When ordering, the young lady who answered the phone had great customer service and was pleasant to talk to."
Carman W.,1,"I love your products and your staff are so professional when dealing with your customers. The reason your getting a bad review is simply your new brown bags they are Crap! My bag ripped and what a mess, icing was all over the container.Not a pretty sight and could not give as a gift."
Edith C.,5,Delicious cakes overall. I love it !! It's always nice and great service too. I do recommend this place
Alexis S.,1,"This has always been my go to place! I started going here even more when my cousin (16 years old) got a job here. It was recently when the manager (Sesai 25 years old) started sexually harassing my cousin who is a minor. As anyone would she went to file a complaint with her other manager (Jori) whom later we found to be best friends with the other manager. My 16 year old cousin started getting treated foul and was terminated with no cause by the manager who sexually harassed her. Her father contacted the owner of the store (Debbie Shwetz) but instead of getting a response, she blocked him on all strings of contact."
Salvi C.,2,Disappointing ribbon .  I'm embarrassed to give this to a friend . They need to be consistent on the little details that makes a big impact.
Canny F.,3,White raspberry bundt cake: frosting too sweet. Which amazes me how it varies between cake flavors. Their cake is consistently super moist but it needs more raspberries.
J'Ceelinn S.,5,"They've been great at helping so much whenever we have a birthday in our house. This is my favorite place for any event! I love the red velvet, but honestly any cake you pick will work. They're soft & fresh!"
Bon A.,4,"Mmm yummy bundt cake!! It's super moist and good!! Maybe a tad too sweet,  but nothing a nice tall glass of milk can't wash down!! :DHowever, I do wish they organized their store line a little better....  When you walk in for the first time,  you kind of just stand there and need to find someone to help you,  otherwise, you look like you're just roaming the store and shopping around...  Yummy,  cute cake shop though! A must try if you haven't :)"
Samantha K.,5,Best cakes ever.  I buy them every time there is. Holiday or a friends bday.  That is a gift in itself.  You can't go wrong w their cakes
Jamie K.,5,"Favorite cake!  White chocolate raspberry is OH MY GOSH incredible.  Ordering is easy and quick.  I've only two problems with this place and neither is a deal breaker:~ Birthday Club, seems bogus.  I've filled out multiple cards for years and have never ever received anything they say I would.~ This location is so far from my house and Eastern is a pain in the butt with the traffic.  Please consider adding a location on Stephanie or Green Valley.  Please oh please."
Mike C.,4,"I recently tried Nothing Bundt Cake at work, brought in for a birthday party. It was my first time trying this cake and I really enjoyed it. A few weeks later I went to their shop to have another go at it. As the first time I tried the cake, marble was my choice, was super moist and the perfect amount of icing. I would definitely buy this cake for any occasion requiring cake!!"
Christine S.,5,"They have the BEST Bundt cakes... and their cream cheese frosting is like no other. It's just a bummer that they close at 6pm Monday - Saturday & are closed on Sundays. But, that just shows how successful they are with the limited hours & days.I've even gotten my friends in Australia to try their cakes & they wish they had a location in Australia!Please expand internationally"
Cynthia R.,5,Called from Cali to place order for my daughters 21st Bday. Everything went smoothly. They delivered to our hotel and the cake was moist and tasty as always. I ordered the frosting in a drizzle tier and added my own flowers and cake topper that I ordered on Etsy ;-)
Estrella M.,5,"Came back to this location, beyond amazed at the difference with customer service since last time I came . From the moment my family and I stepped in the store we were welcomed with smiles and offered their red velvet samples. Waited no more than 10mins for the dozen bundtinies and the girl cashier hand gives the order. I'd like to thank Corporate and store manager for this thank you NBC you guys are the best! Please visit this location very nice employees. These Cakes are exceptional:) from a very happy customer!"
Joe C.,5,"Honestly, what can I say about NBC that hasn't been said already?  Delicious, wonderful and dangerous.   Dangerous because I could crush an entire box of buntinis!  Thank you buntinis for existing."
Mel B.,5,I just called an order in 20 mins ago! I love how really friendly every location is and the price is great for truly fresh cakes. They give military discount and hands down provide great quality products.
Claudia S.,4,Love this shop its super cute and  clean. Staff is always courteous and there are always samples available so you can try all flavors.  Anything you buy here is delicious.
Christopher A.,5,"Nothing Bundt Cakes never fails. All of their cakes are always delicious. My personal favorite is the classic vanilla. I go to the northwest location since I live so far but I had to stop by since I was in the area. The staff was very welcoming and polite. They offered a sample of the new pumpkin spice, which was delicious as well. The gentleman who had helped us was great! My wife only wanted a classic vanilla bundlet and he provided it to us ""on the house"" since he was joking about me being a football fan of a specific team. I didn't expect him to do that but it shows that they appreciate their clients. If I could give more stars, I would. Thank you for providing the best bundt cakes ever."
Nicole V.,4,"Do not come on a holiday. Holy heck I waited til the last minute and damn was that pure stupidity. The line was out the door and then you had no true options to pick from. Very cute decorations. All occasions represented. I've been here about five times for different events, parties or reasons. Adding decorations is extra, adding one simple flag is even extra. (Insert eye roll)Great flavors. Lemon cake, chocolate and chocolate chip are my personal likes. Most people want the red velvet though. I believe they put way too much frosting on them all making them too sweet. this is usually my second choice for friends and family and last choice for myself. The minis are super cute and affordable at a cheap five bucks. The big ones are closer to 35. Not bad for the quality and decorations."
Laurie V.,4,"So cute AND deeeee-lish!!!Ever since I samps'd them for my nephew's 1st birthday..I've been a fan...The chocolate cake and red velvet bundt cakes are my must samps. They have chocolate chips in them =) .....Although I can only have few bites, at a time, because they are SWEET OVERLOAD."
Tracey K.,1,"Never ever again will I go to this place. I had no mask so I was made to wait in the 109 degree heat to pick up my prepaid order. Then it wasn't ready so I was directed to my car to wait. I left. If I didn't prepay I would have canceled. So she wears a mask, touches the door handle that I just touched. Adjusts her mask. Touches the handle again. Ummmm how stupid are business owners right now? To risk losing customers because of their ignorance? I hope they go under now."
Lisa H.,5,"The first time I had Nothing Bundt Cakes, it was at a Bridal Expo a few months ago. Up until that point, I'd wanted to just do cupcakes for the wedding.  I don't like most wedding cakes, I think they're overpriced, and are usually not good.Well the employees from Nothing Bundt Cakes were friendly and nice, and had samples at the expo.  I fell in love.  Moist cakes, with delightful frosting...I decided to use them for my wedding cakes.  I stopped in one day to sample their pumpkin spice bundt (which is heaven, and I'm not even a fan of Pumpkin Spice), and they said they only needed a week's notice for the order. I called in a week before the wedding and placed an order for 4 10 inch bundts: Chocolate Chocolate Chip, Lemon, Pecan Praline, and Pumpkin Spice. Pickup was quick and easy, and prompt. These cakes were a huge hit.  There was barely any left at all for us to bring home!!!  :D  The cakes were moist, sweet, and delicious.  I will absolutely use Nothing Bundt Cakes again for party needs, or just when I'm in the mood for something sweet."
Gabby T.,4,"This is the best place to buy cakes in town! They are not sickeningly sweet. But they aren't flavorless. The cream cheese frosting always compliments the cake, no matter what flavor you get.     My favorite flavors here are the chocolate chocolate chip, pumpkin spice (only available in the fall), and lemon.     They also have free bite-sized samples of their flavors when you walk into the store.     The only downside about this store, is that the organization of the lines is awful. I don't know if it is just this location, or if it goes for all stores, but whatever it is, they need to fix it. You don't know if you're next or not. Sometimes people that are behind you somehow manage to cut in front of you. If they are able to fix this problem, I would be more than happy to rate this location 5 stars. Other than that, I love this store!"
Andrew N.,5,"Nice, clean store.  Kind of reminds me of walking into hobby lobby for cakes, so bring your grandma, she will approve.  Has free samples for you to try.  Spectacular, moist cakes.  My workplace orders them all the time for employee birthdays.  My favourite is the pumpkin spice.  You have to let them sit out to reach room temperature for the best texture.  Clean covered seating outside to enjoy your cake if you are staying on location.  They do not have drinks such as milk to go with the cake though, which would have been great.  Staff are friendly.  3.99 for a small cake which will feed 2-3 (unless you really want cake, which may be the case if you are a sweets person).  Overall, one of the best cake places I have tired in Henderson for moist cakes."
Flora K.,1,"The delivery person came to my door with no mask , we are in the middle of an accelerating pandemic... Coming to my door for an in person delivery with no mask is  unacceptable , No mask ,,  No more bussiness from me"
Bonnie P.,4,"Why can't I stay away from you, Nothing Bundt Cakes? Whenever there's a birthday or celebration, Nothing Bundt Cakes is one of the first things I think of. The cakes are so moist and the icing is just the ""icing on the cake"", you see? These bundts are simply delicious and there's no better way to describe them. I haven't found a flavor I don't like, but my favorites are Marble, Red Velvet and White Chocolate Raspberry. I love the different themes and designs for the cakes and you can add on decorations like flags and bows. The service is excellent. I wish delivery were cheaper. The cakes are reasonably priced, though. And if you're in the mood for one but you don't have a reason for an enormous cake, grab a bundtlet. Mini deliciousness! With these mini cakes there's always a reason to make it bundt time! If you're just not sure or have never had one, go in a try a sample. They're usually by the register. You'll be hooked!"
Cindy A.,5,Purchased 2 dozens to bring back home to Oahu. 1st time and definitely will be jonesing for more.  This place is the bomb diggity.
Vanessa D.,5,I'm a regular in this place get cake every occasion & every possible I can.Today I was help by Courtney & she is the most helpful & friendly staff I ever encountered..
R S.,5,"First of all, these are the most delicious cakes! Superiorly fresh, home made, and just plain perfect! My wonderful Eastern location in Henderson is outstanding in every way. The customer service over the phone is world class, warm, efficient, and friendly. Both Jonathan and Kassandra delivered over the phone service on par with a concierge at an upscale resort on the strip. Thank you so much for offering the entire community the most delicious comfort food during this challenging chapter of all our lives. :)"
Cameron C.,5,"I have used this location for many years for business and I always find them helpful and friendly and especially good at always, always giving me the best quality products for the price.If you've never tried them out before, take the opportunity as you will not regret it. I'm a little amazed at how few people know about this place after all these years."
Brenda Z.,5,"NBC is so moist, and all the flavors delicious.  Love the decor for special occasions, simple and cute.  Carrot, & confett, white choc rasberry are my favorites."
Truly H.,5,"Great place. I use this location to order all sweets for parties!They are always OHHHH, so good!"
Mi Ra P.,2,"We have been ordering cakes from here since last year! Everyone loves their cakes and decorations! A day before, I ordered my daughter's 12th birthday cake, decoration and balloons for her surprise party. However, when I got there to pick up, nothing was done or prepared!  I ordered for specific time of day for special day but I waited almost 45 minutes for picking up the cake and balloons!! I was late for the party and they didn't seem to be sorry!! Nobody seem to cared about it! When I speak up about it, she blamed other employee for not doing their job! They need better management!!"
Yajaira P.,1,First time trying their cakes . The cashier was in such a rush to get me out the door . She kept being short with her replies and didn't even allow me to catch some air with how fast she wanted to charge me and dispatch me smh . Didn't like the customer service at all from there .
Margaret A.,1,"I was very disappointed when I went in today to order my bundtini's  and found out there were no choices. They advertise online that you can customize your dozen. In fact, when I tried  to purchase a larger cake to get the flavor I needed,one that they advertise in the store, they didn't have that either. They had only four choices. So I had to drive 10 miles to another nothing Bundt cakes. They were very eager to please and had everything I needed. I will probably start using this location instead. Got a reply and it was useless because I went into the bakery to begin with so I'm not sure why a phone call would've made any difference"
Karole W.,5,Each and every flavor is absolutely delicious have yet to have a bad experience with the taste the icing should be sold by the buckets. Sometimes there is long lines and longer wait times. Overall it's worth the drive to have a Bundt cake that stays moist and delicious even days after it's been cut
Scott W.,5,"The best Bundt cake I've ever had and the icing was incredible too , greasy and delicious"
James S.,5,Great and friendly staff. I came to this place because a friend gave us a gift card.  The staff greeted us when we walked in and talked to us about all the different types of cakes they have.  We were lucky that we came when we did because within 30 mins there was a line that went out the door.  The cake was delicious and worth checking out
Niki W.,5,"Custom ordered 5 dozen Bundtini's for my Daughters First Birthday! ( they were such a hit at the baby shower I figured we'd make a tradition of ordering varieties of these cakes so everyone has a chance of getting what they like vs. having one big cake that no one really wants to eat and then tons of leftovers) Anyway- the online ordering process is a piece of cake!(haha) I ordered about 5 days in advance. 1 day before they called to confirm my order and let me know one of the flavors was no longer available so I had the option to fill it with another flavor. The lady was sweet, courteous and helpful. On day of pick up, the staff greeted me as soon as I entered the store, brought my 5 dozen bundtinis out and offered assistance to make sure I could get them out to my car ok!  Running into excellent customer service is always a joy. Plus The cakes are DELICIOUS!!! Love love love this place!"
Sara C.,2,Wow terrible pickup plan. Ordered online already paid for and still had to wait outside for 30 minutes to pick. I'm reading that this is a common theme. Such an easy thing to fix. Have an online order pickup area. People have paid already they just want to grab it and get out!
Liz A.,5,My Husband loves this place!!! So Tasting!!Great for Birthday or any occasion!!  Yummy so moist!!
Rhea N.,5,Love this place. Ordering a cake was easy and painless doing it online. For my sister's nursing graduation I surprised her with a 2 tier cake in red velvet and white chocolate raspberry (hello kitty not included lol). My personal favorite is red velvet but white chocolate raspberry is just as delicious!! Their cakes are always moist and always a hit with guests.
Rachel A.,5,"Nothing Bundt Cakes is tha real MVP. Their cakes are always delicious and moist, and their signature frosting is seriously amazing. They're super reasonably priced, their portions are big, and their customer service is always friendly and quick.The best part? They always come in clutch when you need a cake last minute. I called in the morning to see if they could have a decorated birthday cake done by 6? No problem! What about on Christmas Eve for a holiday company party to wow the boss? Of course! What about a big enough cake to feed 18-20 people when the small cake from the local bakery isn't enough? Hell yeah, it'll be done in 20 minutes!Bottom line, this place is awesome if you want a reasonably priced cake that's big enough to feed an entire party. You don't have to call 2 days in advance for a cake like at other bakeries, but the quality is still way better than the ones you get at the grocery store."
Deb A.,5,"I've come to this place almost every month for the past 9 months, and everytime I went inside, the workers are always so kind and welcoming even if it's busy. I will continue to keep going here because the workers are always so kind to their customers. One of the reasons I keep coming here is because their have the little Bundt cakes which is so cute but also is the best way to try all their flavors. All the flavors that I have tried are so moist and not too much frosting even tho it can look like a lot."
Lauren C.,4,Nothing Bundt Cake- you keep showing up in my life and I'm not complaining. A sales rep brought these for the office I work in and I was blown away. The minis are the perfect amount of cake versus frosting. Delicious! I stumbled upon you again at the Foodie Fest and discovered my love for the lemon bundt cake with honorable mention to the pumpkin. Another day a coworker gifted me a red velvet and again it was amazing. I loved the chocolate chip surprises in the red velvet. Keep showing up in my life Nothing Bundt Cake!
Rocio J.,5,I love this place! My favorite favorite cake. As soon as I walk in I always run to the free samples haha. After the young lady greeted me and asked if she could help me. I wanted a cake they didn't have ready get so I just paid and hung out bc she said it was going to take about 20 mins. Came back and they had my cake ready.
Thida P.,5,"One of these days, I'm gonna buy two or three dozen of the Bundtinis and I'm gonna eat it all myself. No sharing, not even with my wonderful boyfriend! Why? Because the bundt cakes from here are that good! I've tried all the flavors but my absolute favorite is the Red Velvet. Mmmm.... I'm drooling right now just writing about it! They're so rich, and moist, and just sooo darn good that you can't just take one or two bites so be careful when you have one sitting in front of you. You might end up eating the whole cake in one sitting. The bundt cakes come in different sizes - bite sized bundtini, bundtlet, 8"" cake, 10"" cake, and tiered cake. If you sign up to be on their email list, they send out coupon specials... I just recently got one for buy one bundtlet and get one free."
Nick L.,1,"I went to this shop last Thursday to buy 2 bundlets around 11:30AM  to see a line out the door. No exaggeration, line was out the door. There were 2 staff which allowed people to cut in line and just walk right up and the staff said nothing while there was a line of people. Staff also took phone orders with a line of people in the store. Staff should know the people who actually come to the store should be served prior to the phone orders being taken. Product tastes good but lousy service is not worth it. Never had a bad experience at Freed's which is in the same shopping center. Avoid this place, long lines, apathetic service, just not worth it."
Lia B.,5,"I love chocolate cakes ONLY. But then came upon Nothing Bundt Cakes; boy was I IN LOVE. RatingsQuality (5)Quantity (4.5)Taste (5)Easiness of ordering online (5)Price (4)Service (4.5)Overall (5) I have tried the marble, red velvet, white white chocolate, and cinnamon swirl. But my TOP favorites are white chocolate raspberry & Chocolate Chocolate Chip.  I can eat a whole 8-inch cake & still crave for more. With that said, I have ordered online for Brad T,'s going away party and the presentation looked beautiful and it was perfect.  I was very pleased with the outcome and of course the taste is magnificent as always.  The frosting that they put on their cake is just the right amount and the sweetness is just right. The prices are reasonable and worth it and it is great for any special occasion or just because!"
Mah S.,3,Definately a cute idea. The appearance you get when walking in is that they mostly service custom orders.  But make your way to the front. You'll find the display glass of individual treats you can purchase. I love the creative names they gave each item. A little to pricey for my budget but was definately appealing to check out.
Jenny F.,1,"If you're going to tell someone to deliberately leave the store for maximum capacity, perhaps that should be consistent. Another lady behind me reached the maximum, yet she wasn't being screamed at to leave the store front. I left to take a phone call & returned to my spot in line. The customer service is absolutely dreadful. It is evident that the staff needs to be retrained. Don't bother notifying management about the issue because they could care less as well. Impertinent people that need to learn to be kinder. Shame on Nothing Bundt Cakes for not hiring properly."
Stephanie T.,5,"The first time I tasted a Nothing Bundt Cake was when my husband's adorable Hobbit co-worker brought one to a gathering at our apartment. I was immediately impressed by the presentation, including the the nicely wrapped box and beautiful frosting. The cake itself (Red Velvet) was delicious, and the frosting wasn't overpowering, which is an issue I have with many cakes and cupcakes.So a month after trying that Red Velvet cake I found myself in Henderson near Nothing Bundt Cakes. A look on their website showed me that their featured monthly flavor was Pumpkin Spice. I am a serious sucker for pumpkin. Every October and November I gluttonously gorge myself on all things pumpkin. So I had to go get an 8"" cake to share with my friends and family.The store itself is located next to a pretty little courtyard with a fountain (a grackle was bathing in the fountain as I walked up to the store). The employees at the store were attentive without being overbearing, and helpfully offered me a sample of a chocolate cake. However good the sample was I was undeterred in my pumpkin goal.It took a little while for the cake to be prepared, but the time passed quickly as I got a Boba tea next store and watched the birds in the water fountain. Before long I had a cake to bring back home.The cake itself was amazing. The pumpkin flavor is subtle, and there is a hint of nutmeg and cinnamon. I have to admit I didn't eat all the frosting on my slice, but there was only a little bit left on my plate. Overall it was delicious. I look forward to trying other flavors in the future!"
Frank W.,1,I sampled a pecan praline bundt before ordering and then took one back to the room.  It turned out to be stale and tasteless.
Diane T.,3,"Love love love the red velvet chocolate chip cake. The cake was so moist and packed with flavor. Also, if you love frosting, man oh man, they have cream cheese frosting for days. I found that the cake wasn't too sweet which was exactly what I like in my baked goods. Often time, the sweetness is overpowering and way to much for someone to handle. I would say, that their mini, individual cakes are the perfect size to share amongst a couple people. This way you can buy several (reasonably priced) cakes and try and assortment of flavors.I was very happy that they also had a gluten free cake which is a definitely win win for me. The staff was very helpful and assisted us right away. I can't wait to check out the location here in LA."
Ricalynn M.,5,"LOVE this place!!! not sure why i didnt go in before. i went to get boba at a place nearby, and saw the sign and thought ""haha...thats clever. nice!"". anyway...one of my friends back home posted a picture from the new location that opened in manhattan beach. saw the website, and joined the mailing list. a few days later, i got a coupon via email for a free bundt cake for ""national bundt cake day"". now i had no reason NOT to go. FREE bundt?!i went in around 230 and the first thing i thought was...""omg it smells sooooo good in here!!!"". the associate there greeted me right away, and pointed out the samples. they had their red velvet out as a sample, and HAD to try it. SOOOOOO GOOOOD!!!! the cake was so moist and it had the perfect amount of frosting on it [the frosting to cake ratio is very key to my cake enjoyment].i got a red velvet and a pecans and praline. unfortunately, i had to work, so i didnt get to eat them until 1am today. and they were absolutely AMAZING!!!!! pecan and praline was sooo tasty and the pecans in there just added so much to it! the red velvet was yummy too! the frosting wasnt too heavy and it was perfect! dare i say, better than cupcakery! and the chocolate chips were a plus too.after we paid, it got a little busy, but the workers there remained friendly and welcoming to each guest. definite plus. when im on this side of town or craving some yummy cake, i will definitely be in!!!!thank you for an amazing first, and definitely not the last, visit!"
Tanya S.,4,"Sometimes when I am cold and all alone I dream of cake and when I do it is always cake from Nothing Bundt Cakes. After having the extremely moist, succulent cake in your mouth you just cannot get enough (sounds a little dirty but sex sells yo!). This is the kind of cake that I could overdose on. You HAVE to try the cakes that have the chocolate chips in them, they are awesome. They pop up like little surprise hugs in your mouth. I mean, who doesn't want that!The icing is amazing and they make soo many flavors. If you have never tried it you have to go....then you too can have little cake dreams like me!"
Michelle L.,5,"How have I never written a review for Nothing Bundt Cakes after they've provided their delicious cakes for countless birthdays, holidays, and special occasions throughout the years?!  Nothing Bundt Cakes makes perfect moist bundt cakes topped with a generous amount of cream cheese frosting.  These cakes are to die for!!  I know that I will be the most popular person in the room anytime I bring one of their bundt cakes to a family gathering, potluck, or office function.  Every single one of their flavors is tasty... you just can't go wrong.  I've been so happy to see them expand across the country over the years because everyone needs to taste these scrumptious cakes!"
Katherine O.,4,"I love Nothing Bundt Cakes!  If you haven't had one before, you are definitely missing out.  They are the cutest cakes!  And what makes it even better is that they taste just as good as they look!  The cake is moist, has amazing flavor, and the frosting is not too sweet.  Its the kind of cake that doesn't make you feel guilty eating the whole thing! I've had the pleasure of eating these cakes for years as gifts, but it's the first time I got to check out their shop and buy some for others.  They have such a cute shop!  They carry a variety of cakes.  You can order special made cakes, or pick from their mini bundt cakes, bundtinis (mini cupcakes), or regular bundt cakes.  They also have samples of their cake in case you wanted to try something new.  The flavor of the day that I had was lemon and it was also delicious!  My favorite flavor is the white chocolate raspberry, but everything that I have tried has been nothing short of amazing.  Some flavors they have are red velvet, lemon, marble, chocolate, and more.  Come in early and catch them before they close at 6!"
Denise Z.,5,So I got the 3 tier mini cakes and I wanted to change one of the flavors last minute and they were fairly busy mind you... but he changed it out for me without blinking an eye. I've been coming here ever since they opened. Still my favorite cake place in town. Always delicious and always fast friendly service!
C A.,2,When it comes to celebrations Nothing Bundt Cakes is my go to. Drove to this location because it is the only one open on Sunday. The clerk Emilie has no customer service skills it seemed she was in a rush to get me out. Noticing that she wasn't being very helpful with my questions I just picked something. I said thank you after paying and she did not respond. She pushed the cake towards me on the counter and walked away. I also have to say that the cake was partially frozen and hard. I've never had a partially frozen hard cake from Nothing Bundt. Will not be returning to this location for future purchases.
Haley C.,1,"Cake was great. The customer service there was terrible. It was not just a single employee there. Majority of them were just so rude and careless. It almost made me not want to get anything there. I get it, they were busy, but they way they put us to wait, the way they approached to us before getting cake from the back, and even when we were paying for it, they were just rude. This place really need to either train their employees or replace them. Their attitude is not for any place where they have to deal with customers face to face."
Anthony B.,4,I didn't realize how much of a bundt cake fan i was until i tried this place. Its a bit expensive but taste great. Good for special occasions or in the mood for cake.
Laurie M.,5,"Thank you!  I live out of state, and when I could not get my original cake order delivered to my daughter on her birthday (which is New Years Eve!) I phoned this location to see if they had anyone available to deliver a cake.  It seemed pretty hopeless as it was nearly 2:00 p.m.on New Year's Eve.   They stopped a delivery driver ""Ty"" as he was leaving for the day and he made it happen for us!.  It is not easy having a birthday on New Year's Eve and Nothing Bundt Cakes made it a very special birthday by delivering a beautifully decorated cake to her.  It was New Year's Eve and they could have easily said no.  Instead, they made this a VERY special day for my daughter who was celebrating her birthday without family.  She said the cake (which was double chocolate chip) was perfect and the decorations actually made her cry. We had a Skype call to sing Happy Birthday to her and thanks to two very special employees, she was able to celebrate her birthday with a beautiful cake and a Skype call that made it feel like we were all together.Thank you to all involved, especially the employee that took my call and made all of this happen"
Anabell V.,5,First time coming into this place and it's a cute little store. I ended up getting a 2 tier bundt cake for my brothers birthday which I choose red velvet and white chocolate raspberry. They made it all cute with a ribbon. I also bought a carrot cake and chocolate single bundt. Overall great service the cakes are delicious and so moist. I LOVE their red velvet cake.
Connie D.,3,"This is going to be on the level of blasphemy, I know. But I remember during the early Nothing Bundt Cakes days their cakes were beyond moist with an out-of-this-world cream cheese frosting.  Then after a few years, I started to detect some differences - the cake was sometimes moist and (God forbid!) they started cutting in regular glaze frosting into the cream cheese!!  A small part of me died.  I used to joke with my co-workers exclaiming, ""I could dive into that center pool of cream cheese!""  But alas, the business has succumbed to the old ""maybe the customers won't notice if we pull back a little on the quality.""  I have news for Nothing B-Cakes - this customer noticed..But, you have nothing to worry about.  You have many fans and will continue to thrive as long as the majority don't care about slight slips of quality; however...be careful how far you decide to go."
sarah T.,5,"Always irresistible, delicious sweet cakes with cream-cheese frosting. I wish these places were open later and I wish there were more locations in general."
Lindsey B.,3,Employees don't pay attention to customers. Where I work if someone walks In The door you automatically stop what your doing to assist a customer. This was ridiculous to see 4 employees and a line of 6 people with no service. Had to wait 5 minutes tell the first group got to take their order.
C O.,5,"Where to begin? Best cake I've ever had. Their chocolate chocolate chip is the business. I called an hour before we were supposed to go to a friends house and I fully expected them to laugh and say there was no way they could put in an order for me. Justin answered the phone and said it could be ready in 15 minutes! I've never been so happy. I ordered an 8 inch unfrosted ($21) and because it was my boyfriend's birthday, Justin was the sweetest and added a birthday bundlet they give out when you sign up for their newsletter. Even though my boyfriend wasn't there, he included it anyway and I thought that was so great! They also sell number candles and cute fill in the blank books, which ended up being my boyfriend's birthday gift. This place is the best and thank you for outstanding customer service."
Silvia C.,5,They are the real deal. So so sooooo delicious. And I love the cupcakes/individual size too. Very  pleased with their work. Listened to my requests and it was perfect.  Love the locationntoo
Jeremy M.,1,"This location of Nothing Bundt Cakes should be ashamed of the way you treat your employees. When the father of one of your employees requests to meet with you because his daughter was being hit on by her manager and you refuse, that's cowardice and a terrible way to run your business. When a 16 year old girl is harassed and you allow the very person who harrased her to terminate her without just cause, well that's an open and shut case for a wrongful termination lawsuit. Better call your insurance carrier Debbie Shwetz and add the ""employee lawsuit rider"" if you don't already have it, because your former employee has a classic open and shut case for harassment and wrongful termination. It's sad that in today's world that you couldn't have had the decency to simply meet with the dad and daughter and take the proper steps to discipline your manager. Oh well, guess you'll be finding out the hard way when business decreases because of your actions or lack thereof. I know I'll no longer spend a dime at your store."
Liz I.,3,"I am more than happy to overpay for these delicious cakes... but WHY oh WHY do they not provide you with a single spoon or fork? It's beyond me. What's even more ghetto is that they send you next door to the hot dog place to gank theirs. Sheesh! I'll even fork over the extra dime for a flippin' plastic fork! Or maybe they could scootch a little of their sticker budget from their bags for some utensils. As soon as they change their policy on this, I will happily change my review to 5 stars because their cakes are deelish!"
Ayanna J.,5,"We come here to get our bundt cakes at least once a month! Every time they have a new flavor, we are there to try it"
Carolyn F.,5,"Forget that boxed bundt cake that you make yourself. Just forget it. This is a whole 'nother something that, after one bite, you will not forget. You might know cake, you might know gennoise, you might know frosting. After a N.B.C cake, your cake-tastebuds will be re-set. I don't know what they do, how they do, to these cakes but it is beyond amazing. They offer mini-bundts (single servings) or the big party-size, all in very yummy flavors combos (cinnamon, white choc, dark choc, raspberry, etc...), but it is the super moist texture AND flavor AND I think maybe some love mixed in that produces this magical and unforgettable sweet experience. Most things aren't worth breaking the diet for, but this is. I just discovered that some Capriotti's are also carrying the mini bundts.What Allison said... ""Oh Man!"" --- that's what you'll say. I promise."
Mercedes H.,1,"Today when I went in I wasn't greeted by anyone. As I was ordering I was dealing with Naomi and Jonathan. I have just got to say that is the worst customer service I've experienced here. They were rude to me. They evidently thought their conversation was more important than helping me, and in doing so got my order wrong. Because of Naomi and Jonathan I will never be going to this location again."
Jenn W.,5,"I came for an order pick up. My order was ready earlier than expected & Madison carried my order out to my car because I had my toddler in a stroller! Stellar customer service! Thank you, Madison!"
Jill K.,5,Nothing Bundt Cakes is ALWAYS a good idea!! Every flavor is yummy and the cream cheese frosting is the perfect amount of sweetness. Don't hesitate... just go!
Teri S.,5,"I am  always greeted with a smile and warm welcome. The owners are extremely nice. The cakes are really delicious and great for all occasions-birthdays, new babies, etc. Don't hesitate and give them a visit, you won't be disappointed"
Janice S.,2,When I got inside to pick up my order the white girl on the cashier and the other girl I don't know if she's Spanish were talking both to their customers. I stand on the blue marks as I'm supposed to. No one said will be right with you or anything. Then there comes this American/White lady maybe in her late 50's or early 60's as she enter the store she was greeted by this white girl in the cashier even she is still with her customer.  So me as an Asian girl don't deserve to be greeted! And one more thing when the other girl is done with her customer she gave the other lady behind me her order instead of me who is inline first. One more thing I expected that the birthday flag is inside the cake box but I checked when I got home and there's wasn't any while the white cashier girl said there's should be one inside. Damn what a bad experience today. I bought cakes from nothing bund cake many times but today is nothing but poor customer service is what I got.
JoAnne M.,2,"I don't see how anyone can say these are great.  Maybe they don't cook, maybe because the cake is a cute little design, but these are just so-so.  First, they taste like they came out of a box.  Then, they use the exact same frosting for every. single. one.  They use this high-sugar frosting and everyone thinks the cake is spectacular.  Buy a cake in any other bakery and it's much better and at least has a variety of frostings which are specific to the cake; they don't use the same one, and if they did you'd probably go somewhere else which is why I can't understand why everyone thinks buying a cupcake-sized cake with no variety is wonderful.  Maybe because the frosting is so thick you get a sugar rush, but they don't have a lot to recommend them otherwise."
Bianca C.,5,I had been wanting to try Nothing Bundt Cakes so I thought Father's Day would be a perfect excuse for a cake! I drove to the rainbow location but it was closed. They close on Sundays. I went on line and seen that there Henderson location is open on Sundays so I was set on trying them so I drove all across town and glad I did. I decided on the white chocolate raspberry flavor and Father's Day decor which was beautiful. The cake was so moist and delicious! Will definitely be my go to cake for special occasions!
Shar B.,5,"All I can say is, ""OH MY GOD, I'M IN HEAVEN!"" These have to be the best cakes on the planet!The girls behind the counter are so sweet lol and helpful.We now make this place our offical birthday, special occasion and just because cake place."
Hannah B.,1,"I called them to order and was put on hold for 25 minutes without anyone talking to me. I walked into the store, as I called from work while driving there, and it was not busy enough to ignore my call for 25 minutes. I'm never coming here again."
Adam L.,4,"Bring your own fork.Seriously.  Otherwise this place was amazing. Needed a quick pre flight pick me up and grabbed one of the personal sized cakes.  These were totally delicious and well worth the cost.   Staff was nice, if not a little busy.  My only real gripe is that we were told we couldn't have forks because they are taxed and would cause the company to have to raise the cost of their cakes again.  While, as a consumer I can appreciate lower prices, five more cents for a fork kind of makes sense, seeing as I was grabbing and eating to go.  Stopped next door, grabbed a free, untaxed fork and was on my way."
Anthony G.,2,"Had such an unpleasant experience with the girl helping me out today. I ordered 2 dozen bundtini's almost a week ago for pickup today. I went in to get them and she was so unbelievably rude and seemed frustrated that there was people inside ordering. I told her the name it was under and she came back two seconds later and said ""Nope. We don't have it"". And proceeded to pick up the ringing phone instead of helping me figure out where my order was. I gave her the phone number, credit card number, and first and last name and still told me she had no record of my order, all while helping other people instead of me. Sure enough, they finally found it. With the exact name I told her.  The cakes were yummy but she was AWFUL. Customer service is everything and it's what keeps customers coming back. Her name on my receipt was Madison M. and I really hope management has a conversation with her."
Cherie P.,5,"I was never a big fan of bundt cakes, but Nothing Bundt Cakes has changed my mind. One of my friends offered me their smaller bundt cakes awhile back and it tasted amazing. I decided to check out the store for myself and the ladies behind the counter were friendly and sweet.One of them offered me a sample of pecan praline cake and I decided to try it out even though I've never been a big fan of pecan praline. Simply delicious. I purchased a chocolate, chocolate chip bundt cake with no regrets and I would go back whenever I'm in the neighborhood."
Mary A.,5,"Nothing Bundt Cakes has become a family tradition. Everyone wants a bundt cake for their birthday, graduation, babyshower, house warming party, and ANY other event possible.  The look of the cake and decorations is STUNNING but the moist interior is EVEN better. The flavors are classics but you'll never get tired of them. Bring this to your next party and everyone will LOVE YOU !!!!"
Alex S.,5,The bomb!! It might not be a cheap place to have a super upgraded cupcake for a dessert fix. It is too good not to at least spoil yourself a few times. The red velvet and white chocolate are outstanding. The icing is so silly good on everything. Perfect cakes. It can get very busy late afternoon. Line out the door. Great place.
Connie C.,4,"Who knew they had stores that only sold fancy bundt cakes?  A Las Vegas original, Nothing Bundt Cakes rivals the best cupcake places I've tried.  My Favorite Flavors:Red Velvet - Surprising chocolate chips in the red velvet & cream cheese frosting make this the best I've tried.Carrot - Cream cheese frosting on top of delicious carrot cake.Chocolate - Chocolate cake with chocolate chips and chocolate frosting. If you love chocolate, you'll love this chocolate overload.Sizes: The mini bundt cakes are perfect for one (hungry) person. The full size version is just as tasty and works perfectly for celebrations. Prices: They are definitely not cheap at $4.50 per mini. The full-size bundt cakes at almost $30 and a decorated one will set you back nearly $40. But who can resist the moist cake and the perfectly sweet frosting on each cake?  Just found out they have Nothing Bundt Cakes in the Bay Area too in Los Gatos and Dublin. Woohoo!"
Adam C.,5,I love love love this place. So moist and so fresh. It's so obvious that they put their passion into their cakes. It's absolutely amazing. If you haven't tried one go for it with clear mind. Your taste buds bout to dance like Saturday night fever
Elizabeth A W.,5,Never disappointed. The cakes have a rich moist flavor and the icing is always the right amount! Great treat to bring to a party!
Rachel B.,5,I came here today to get a litte bundtini for a friends birthday!  It was my first time here and I absolutely loved it.  The girl behind the counter was on the phone with a complicated customer and she kept her cool and provided great service.  They have cute holiday serving dishes and different decorations that you can browse while you wait and they even have samples!Once I was assisted she was so anticipatory.  She informed me about their email program where you get a free bundtini on your birthday and offered me a punch card where on Mondays you get double punches!  She asked if I needed it wrapped for a gift.I will definitely be back!  Absolutely fantastic service!
Shanice B.,5,"A friend introduced me to Nothing Bundt Cake, and I fell in loveThe bakery is clean, smells amazing, and they offer samples. Prices for the mini bundt cakes are so reasonable. I got 2- (White chocolate raspberry/white chocolate) and both were so delicious. The total was around $7.00!They also do personalized cakes, mini cakes, anything u can think of. Best Cake IN VEGAS"
Taemee F.,5,"These cakes are super delicious!!! Beautiful presentation for any event, simple or extravagant. The cakes just melt in your mouth and are good for days!! I love these cakes they are terrific and you will not be disappointed."
Howie D.,5,"Came in to buy some Bundt cake. Fast service. right after I paid for my cakes in cash, I asked if they could break a $20 bill for me. I was told that he did not break bills here.  A little annoyed.  Come on guys. It wasn't like I was asking you to break $100 bill."
Detroit R.,5,"What in the world????? Oh my goooooodness!!!! This is good cake. My opinion is based solely on the lemon cake. Flavor is great!! Very light and moist. I'm sure the other flavors are just as good. I love that fact that I can get a small serving of cake. Since I'm a health nut, it doesn't make me feel so bad indulging. Customer service was great. Everyone in the store was extremely welcoming and nice."
Michelle C.,5,Always yummy! Had the pumpkin spice but cake for their seasonal and uuughhhh so good! My favs are red velvet and choc choc chip
Dawn G.,5,I love their cupcakes. They are so moist and delicious. My favorite flavor is the strawberry which is seasonal. Can't wait to taste the raspberry and lemon. The only bad thing is the give out samples. They want me to stay fat. Lol. This is my favorite cake spot ever.
Mollie B.,5,Drove here to redeem a free Bundt cake I received from going to the Foodie Fest. And just like their display tent there... The product was amazing. The staff was so friendly. And the location set up was very clean and organized. I just wish they were closer! We got the red velvet Bundt cake and it was superb!
Kellie B.,5,"The besttttt bundt cakes EVER! So most and the flavors are really delish. Everytime we drive by, I have to stop in and get a few of their mini bundt cakes, they never disappoint!"
Bethany D.,5,Always great bunts! My favorite is the lemon but I would never turn down any other flavor! Perfect for office or birthday!
Alexandrina B.,5,White chocolate raspberry is our favorite! Delicious every time They do not disappoint!
Gee S.,5,Yum... Yummy bunt cakes!  Simply delicious! There are many flavors for everyone to enjoy.
Ben J.,5,Always delicious and moist cakes. Kids parties whatever we come here great service and even better cakes.
Paul B.,5,Great Customer ServiceAll the staff especially Avery and Madison! Love the bundtinis!!! The Best!!! Thanks! :)
Pink L.,5,"Tip: if ordering the dozen mini cupcake style bundts, call ahead so they can prepare your order instead of waiting there. It takes them about 15 min to prepare the order as they need to frost them and put them in the box. No idea why it can take that long haha kind of odd but at least if you know to call ahead by the time you drive there your order will be ready. Call in orders must be paid over the phone with a card. A dozen is $20. Tasted fresh and delicious. My fav is red velvet and my friends love the chocolate one."
K. K.,1,"Absolutely horrible customer service. My husband waited over thirty minutes in line to be told there was nothing available and he would have to wait at least another hour for them to bake more. He was told they had NOTHING available. Holiday or not, that is unacceptable. At least have the courtesy to let people that are waiting outside in the heat that they are wasting their time. They must not need the business."
Jay A.,5,"As the name suggests, this bakery does nothing but bundt cakes. But not just bundt cakes, bundt cakes of all sizes, bundt cakes of all flavors, and bundt cakes for all occasions. Ok so now I am going to attempt to write the rest of this review without using the words ""bundt cake"" anymore. I got the small size white chocolate raspberry! It was great and just the perfect size, in the past I have had the chocolate and the red velvet both great as well. This type of thing could give the cupcake and the donut a run for their money. So I say stop in support this local bakery and enjoy the next big thing before it is the next big thing. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"
Mary Rose F.,4,"Came in here the other day for the first time... For what, you may ask??!! NOTHING BUNDT CAKES! I haven't had one of these in years, so my friends and I all got 2 mini bundt cakes in hopes that we get to share and taste each and every flavor!! :) These cakes never fail! They are always perfectly moist and perfectly sweet. I am excited for the day I crave them some more!"
Natalia E.,2,"Great cakes but the staff is very rude. I've been coming here for years and they were always great but today was one of the worst experiences. I ordered the cake to be ready by noon and when I showed up at 1245 it was still not ready and the girl told me ""we have too many orders"". Well, maybe if your service continued to be this way the number of the orders will decrease. The vibe in the store was pretty bad and as soon as I walked in I was rudely informed ""there is only one line"". I don't think I'll be coming back from now on."
April S.,5,"Our family LOVES Nothing Bundt Cakes, that it's often our birthday cake choice. White Chocolate Raspberry is my favorite! What I like about Nothing Bundt Cakes is that the cake is always super moist and that each slice you get has just enough icing- not too much, not too little. And another plus is the icing is very good. Never had any issues with customer service at this location. Usually in and out with not much wait time."
Terry S.,1,"Awful customer service. I came in at 5:53pm and asked for a carrot cake. Told me it would take 15 minutes to ice and they wouldn't have time to do it before closing at 6pm. They wouldn't stay 5 minutes past closing to ice a cake for a customer who visits this shop at least 6 times a year. Unfortunately, this is the last time I will visit Nothing Bundt Cakes."
Lauren M.,5,"This place is awesome! I had a friend invite me to eat here and I was like ""why would I want to go eat nothing but bundt cakes? I want variety!"". I was wrong. The place is a cute little place next to a pizza place and boba tea, perfect when you want more to eat. I absolutely love the chocolate chip bundt cake. I get the small size as the large is too big but I could probably finish it in a few days because it is so good. It has small chocolate chips in it which I love. Sometimes they run out of the small ones early which sucks. The only thing I suggest is more flavors for the cakes! Perhaps a caramel or butterscotch that would be delicious.They also have marble flavored cakes which are good as well, though not as good as the chocolate. Anyways check this place out!"
Rochelle P.,5,"Great service and yummy cakes.  I would love maybe adding some tropical flavors. ...like coconut,  pineapple,  mango, banana."
Brett R.,5,"Amazing Bunt cakes. Amazing in that once you have one, you will likely crave them for the rest of your days. Yes, they are that good. They have rotating seasonal flavors - while the standard flavors are good... sometimes you find a seasonal gem that takes it up a level. If you don't try this place then obviously you must hate dessert."
Treneka J.,4,I ordered two decorated cakes for our Amazing Veterinarian's over at Horizon Veterinary clinic last minute. I placed the order online at 10am and my order was ready for pick up by noon. Thank you for saving the day. Nothing Bundt Cake!!
Alesha C.,5,WHY ARE THESE CAKES SO AMAZING. LIKE WHY? Every single time I visit Las Vegas it's a must that I come. I've been in Vegas for 6 days and I've been here 3 times. This is ridiculous. They're so good
Jonny P.,5,They have MANNERS and GREAT cakes!! I'll be back!! Selection was on point!! Inviting atmosphere.
Nikki F.,5,"I've always took notice to the name, bakery and delivery vehicles that I've seen throughout California and Nevada. It wasn't until a month ago that I actually had my first taste when a colleague brought them to work.... Well oh my damn! I've always been a cupcake girl and frequent a very publicized bakery in Henderson until NOW!! Not only are the bundt cakes delish with a great variety to choose from, the reception upon walking through the doors was upbeat and inviting and their pricing is reasonable and on point. The manager took great care in making sure we knew all about the bakery, it's incredibly flavorful cakes and provided a sample of its current flavor... Snickerdoodle! The cute kitchen and giftware they have available makes for a great one stop shop. Hosting a birthday party provided a great opportunity for a variety of bundtinis and the feedback by EVERYONE was that they couldn't believe how moist and incredibly tasty they were from the cake to the heavenly richness of the cream cheese icing. Several said that they now prefer these over the cupcakes hands down. To my new love.... Nothing Bundt Cakes, I will be back"
Tina D.,2,"2 stars because of excellent customer service. The chocolate chocolate chip cake I tried was terrible, tasted like pure sugar with artificial chocolate flavoring and there were no actual chocolate chips unless they were melted in but even so I won't go back."
Rose B.,1,"I had to wait for my order outside in the heat, while it was being made. As it was sitting in the fridge, they didn't bother coming outside to give to me when I was told they were. Wondering why it took so long, it was sitting in the fridge, while still waiting in the heat. Finally asked what was taking so long, they said ""Oh, here it is!"" That was really bad customer service"
Lisa S.,5,The is my favorite!! I love how they have new flavors of the month. They are great cakes I always get them for every occasion. I totally recommend it. Delicious flavors I love all of them.
Suzie S.,5,"highly recommended. Very clean, very well-stocked love the set up. They're very busy so call ahead but they're very popular also in the line goes fast. Staff is very friendly prices are a little bit high but the product is amazing. Plenty of parking and very convenient. The only thing I would change is I wish they had coupons or A stamp card."
Annamarie D.,5,"Amazing...all of it. Red velvet and GF Choco chip cookie are definitely our faves. Plus nothing bundt cakes definitely scores some brownie points with all their buy one get one coupons! It's a nice sweet treat for the kids or anyone else I decide to bring them to. Even the little bundlets last us two servings so 4 servings for our family to have a nice little dessert for -$4. Fresh,tasty, and customer service never disappoints!"
Kevin O.,3,"I would give 3.5 if I could. Never had a bad cake! Lucky for them everything is so good because they have ZERO customer service. I got one for my B-day and left it on the dinning table, well I found out my dog likes it too, he ate the WHOLE thing! So, now back to the store to wait inline to have someone who apparently hates their job to sell me a cake.More great cakes next door but customer service is just as bad. Are they owned by the same people?????"
Townsend C.,1,"I called ahead to pick up a cake for one of my clients birthday. I have given Nothing Bundt Cakes as a brand a lot of my business over the years, and today I think I may have purchased my last cake with them. Call it trivial or call what you want but I believe that of a business has a protocol and a standard procedures for post quarantine, I believe everyone should be held to that standard. I walked in to pick up my cake and was asked if I had a mask? I did not have a mask and I stated that I was there to pick up a cake. The attendant asked me my last and first name and then proceeded to ask me to wait outside as she would bring my cake to me. I agreed without reluctancy. The next patron that walked in after me as soon as I walked out to the front and waited was a mother and adolescent pre teen. The mother had a mask and and her son (12-13 years old) did not? He was not asked to wait outside as they were both in the shop for 7-10 minutes without any issue. It's the little things that make or break a business. And it's because of this reason that I probably won't be back. I understand wearing a mask not just for myself but for the safety of others around me but I don't understand why I was asked to leave and wait outside and the patrons after me were not.  Be consistent not with just a few people but ALL PEOPLE."
Victoria G.,5,"Such simple cakes, but so delicious. We have tried many flavors over the years. Family favorites are the Chocolate, Red Velvet, Lemon, Vanilla and Carrot. Will continue to get cakes for special occasions."
Kate L.,5,My two Young boys and I stopped in since we were in the area for a bundtlette. The super sweet girls in there tonight made my kids day and gave them the balloons they had up for a display. Thank you so much girls. You made their night! They even went to bed with their balloons! Lol. Oh and the red velvet was so delicious!
Kathy M.,5,Nothing but good to say about this store. Cakes are delicious and customer service is great. I was welcomed in with smiles by Jacqueline and Sophia and they helped me with my order. As I waited for my bundtinis there was a long line out the door and these two lovely girls moved the line quick and made everyone leave with a smile and truly wanted each customer to leave with happiness. Amazing customer service and the cakes are unbeatable. Thank you Nothing Bundt Cakes!
Emily R.,4,"I just can't seem to say no to bundt. We usually get them delivered for special occasions and holidays at work, but I rarely go on my own to get anything, just too dangerous. I enjoy that they have small bundts as an option now. Since I rarely get to see the inside of these shops, I was happily surprised by all the samples. I didn't partake on this particular occasion since I was trying to be good, but the smells were heavenly and service was extremely attentive. My favorite flavors are always the fruity ones. I can never resist lemon or raspberry bundt. I'm not a huge fan of cream cheese frosting, but I have it on good authority that I'm one of the rare people who feels that way. Great treat for holidays, gifts or any occasion really."
G H.,2,I had a cake from here. Just as short as my review..... nothing special and nothing worth remembering. Lovely staff but the cakes just weren't that tasty and very dry. I've had better from Albertsons.
Zoe M.,5,"Courtney is amazing! She was the nicest and I had the best experience with her! This is a late review( I went in for my birthday in February). She was so helpful and helped me pick the perfect cake! Thank you, Courtney!!"
Molly T.,4,"I've been wanting to try them forever and one day before my yoga class down at Body Heat I stopped in for a little bundtlet. First things first, can we just talk about how adorable the words ""bundtlet"" and ""bundtini"" are? I'd buy a bunch of cakes just so I could be like Oprah and say ""You get a bundlet! And YOU get a bundtlet! And you, and you, and YOU get a bundtlet!"" I walked in and the girls working were quick to jump. They explained everything that they had. The shop is smaller than I expected it to be, I guess. But I digress. Anyway, I decided on a red velvet bundtlet and was on my merry way.I arrived in the parking lot of the yoga studio and dug in. I play little food games with myself (see my review for In-N-Out Henderson) and my dear friend Jaime W. suggested I add the rule that nobody can see you eat in your car. This rule was especially apt when eating outside a yoga studio. I was definitely caught a few times but who cares, not me.The cake was good. Not great, but really really good. I thought it was the teeniest bit dry. I know that bakeries don't make their cakes fresh every day, so I'm guessing that I got a cake on its way out. It was tasty (I f&#%ing love cake so even the dry ones get four stars from me)!Will come back, though perhaps under different circumstances."
Minh D.,5,"Imagine the most scrumptious, moist, buttery, savory, cake in the world and multiply that times 2!!I became an addict after trying white chocolate raspberry. They come in all sizes. I was never a cupcake fan, but I can enjoy these bundt cakes all day long!"
Victoria Q.,5,"Trust me when I say that a nothing bundt cake will solve all of your problems. These cakes are orgasmic! The flavors are to die for and the cake is moist and just deliciously finished with their amazing crème cheese frosting. All of their flavors are great. It is pretty much impossible to get a bad tasting cake here. My favorites are the red velvet or white chocolate raspberry. They have bundtlet cakes, which are mini bundt cakes for single servings which is what I usually get rather than the larger cakes. (Bundtlets are only 4$)The bundt cakes come in the following sizes:- bite sized bundtini (sold by the dozen) -bundtlet-8"" cake-10"" cake-tiered cakeI just love Nothing Bundt Cakes!"
Hannah M.,1,"I came into the shop one day and as I was looking around I heard this guy asking if they were still hiring. I didn't care at first, though I did see a glimpse of what he looked like and he was his own size. After the manager told him that they weren't hiring he left. I soon then heard THE MANAGER talking about the man that just came in. JUDGING his size and making fun of him. She then said very loudly and clearly ""he's too fat to work at my store"". NEVER going to that location EVER."
Shawn J.,5,"For my fiancee's birthday she dropped the hint that she would like a cake from Nothing Bundt Cakes. We've become fans of the location on W. Sahara, but had not tried the location on Eastern which is closer to where we live. I started out by going online to place an order...but I had waited too long and the website doesn't allow same day orders. Dang the luck. So I decided to call in and see if they could do a same day order over the phone. From start to finish everything was perfect. There was no hassle with taking my order complete with special requests or processing my debit card. I was quoted a pick up time of any time after 4 pm. When I stopped by at 5:15 they had no trouble finding my order and they brought out a 10 inch chocolate / chocolate chip cake wrapped up in clear plastic that made for easy and safe transport without squishing the buttercreme frosting that went down the sides of the cake There were no mistakes on my special requests either, and the cake looked great. When I brought the cake home the reactions started at oh, wow!, and went on from there. But when the cake looked so good it caused two family members to break their diets to try it and they had second helpings, well..what else can I say. It was awesome. And when the birthday girl smiled from ear to ear and said it was perfect...if she's happy, that's the only thing that really matters. 5 Stars. Taste / Service / Taste / Service/ ok, the 5th star is because it's so dang good! (And while it's a franchise, it's a Vegas based franchise...and it's a place that will get my repeat business!)(Yelp 100 in 2013 Challenge #31)"
Brittany G.,5,"This place is seriously addicting. They took a simple concept and made it truly amazing. They're a bit pricey, but once you have a taste, you'll start making weekly visits. Nothing Bundt Cakes is my go-to for all family birthday cakes.  I highly recommend the lemon, lemon raspberry (when in season) and their red velvet!"
Vanessa P.,5,"This place has the best bundt cakes/bundt cupcakes ever..Omgt the frosting is just Delicious. The actual cake is so moist and full of flavor.So far I have tried the Red Velvet, Strawberry, and chocolate.They are so all so wonder full I don't what else to say right now cuz I'm still working on eating this bad boy but. I would highly recommend that you give this place a try...."
Skylar H.,5,So yummy ! I love anything with cream cheese and they have it as the topping for the bundt cakes! I love the fact that they don't over due it on the icing on the cakes! A little bundlet is simply enough for me! I loved the confetti but it was a limited time :(! I just recently tried the pumpkin spice very very good! I bought the package deal of four mini bundlets for $20 you also get an insulated bag and a free bundlet coupon for next time ! Such a great deal! They have pretty good customer service! But It does suck as they close a bit earlier around 6 as I don't get off work till 8!
Esme H.,4,I cannot stand the fact that everybody in Las Vegas loves this place so much I just think it's mediocre but people swear by them so I gave it a benefit of the doubt and I am not into these cakes at all I have never been inside of the shop but I have several girlfriends that always have these cakes at their houses or they bring them to the restaurants and we celebrate birthdays there's always a Bundt cake from this place have I tried it isn't my favorite absolutely not but are they terrible no the icing is very good but there's just something very weird about them and I have always just rolled my eyes at the fact that there was a Bundt cake in there because there's so many better places to get cakes fromI know that this is an odd review but I never spit it out I always tried to taste it and give it the benefit of the doubt I don't know how much they cost because like I said I've never ordered one nor have I been to the shop but I have had a little bit here and there over the past 7 yrs But like I said people swear by them
Sam C.,4,"came here to bring a package of goodies to visit a friend in the city...they have the assorted mini bundt cakes, great for sharing....affordable..and different from the popular cupcakes gifts (sprinkles) .....theres a few sizes too, the mini, regular individuals, and the cake sizes...convenient based on the occasion ur purchasing!!!i always liked bundt cakes but never had special flavors until coming here...pineapple upside down and red velvet all the way!!!store is being cheap about giving you a bag though to carry my order..i got 2 dozens of the assorted and they said they have no bags to give away for that size... i had to buy a separate one for 2+...that was my only problem...if u go into the place to buy stuff they should give u a bag to hold it in...not something fancy u have to buy separately.."
Samantha B.,1,Great cake but the one star is for the customer service. This past week I tried to place a bundtini order. I placed my order online but called the store to add an additional 12 to my order I already placed. The girl left me on hold for about 12 MINUTES! Then gets back on and not only apologizes for completely forgetting about me but couldn't even help me with my order not sure what went wrong I then out of frustration told the girl I would like to just cancel my order she then said she couldn't cancel it for some reason but will have a manager call me to cancel. Never got a call so I drove down there (45mins) to confirm if the order was still there as the charge still appeared on my card. Just a nightmare in all. Won't be back to this location.
Megan M.,4,My husband and I needed to give a gift to someone who has everything.  We have each eaten Nothing Bundt Cakes before and thought it would be a sweet treat as a gift.  We got our friend the full sized red velvet cake.  She really enjoyed it!  We got ourselves the mini to share!  The cake is so delicious and moist.  Really cute shop with a helpful staff.  They have 2 locations and both deliver.  Prices aren't bad...the minis are only $4 and the biggest cake you can get (which I think feeds up to 18 people) is only $28.  Not a bad way to say thanks or just treat someone!
Janel S.,4,"If you are looking to celebrate an occassion with a bang, and want your friends, families, or co-workers talking about that awesome cake you just bought, buy a bunt cake! Want to get in good with the big man? Get a bunt cake.I think their presentation, taste, and creativity of a bunt occassion cake is genious! The presentation is very clean and whimsical! The taste is wonderful, and the cake is sure to soft and spongy. My favorite part is the frosting-thick, creamy, and sweet. Reminds me alot of that nice frosting that is glazed on a Starbucks Lemon Loaf cake (excluding the lemon flavor of course). It just pairs so well with any flavored bunt. Suggestively, get the red velvet or chocolate. It is sure to win the hearts of others.Only downside, it is pricey. I assume because of the quality and excellent presentation. If you're crafty, try making one yourself, but if you prefer to avoid any chance of disater, buy a bunt! Even sample the miniature ones! It's sure to win your heart."
David A.,4,"I never even knew about this sweet bundt cake store until my Fiance recently requested to stop here on the way home after lunch one day.She stopped to get me my favorite cake of all, red velvet with cream cheese frosting. She purchased me an individual sized red velvet bundt and it was delicious!The cake was fresh, moist, tasty and the frosting was generous and very creamy.My Fiance has cut out sweets in her diet so she just stopped to get me a treat to make me happy as she always does. Thanks to my woman I am now a fan!"
Debbie N.,5,"These are so good. I mean really good. I bought the bundtlets which are the perfect size for 1-2 people. The cake is moist and the cream cheese frosting is just sweet enough. My favorite is the marble.It looks like they have multiple franchise locations in California and next time I'm in SF, I'm going to make sure I buy it for someone's birthday or event just so I can have some. lol"
Regina I.,4,"I usually visit the Manhattan Beach store, which makes sense since I live in the South Bay (CA). womp womp womp... Anyway, I visited my sister in Vegas for Christmas and we decided that what we needed to end our holiday meal were these bundt cakes so trekked over the store to snap some up. It's very rare to find consistencies between stores, particularly in the service department, but walking into this store was like walking in the Manhattan Beach store- as if both experiences were taking place mirroring each other. Instantly the decor, the warmth, and the staff made for such a pleasant entrance. The only difference I came across was that I couldn't have all the flavors at once, at least not during the holidays. It was explained to me that their store limited their flavors for the season, which given their traffic and probable demand for the larger cakes made sense (I believe, after all, that the Vegas stores are the firsts) so that got a pass. And, in any case, the chocolate and pumpkin chocolate chip cakes were walked out with ended our meal perfectly (reviews of these and the other flavors can be found here http://www.yelp.com/biz/nothing-bundt-cakes-manhattan-beach#hrid:ZaPr5rwhdTigCoq4aLaU1w."
Ernest H.,4,"I love the cakes here and it would have gotten 5 stars but the service was not that friendly. First off, the 4 stars is for the quality of the product. The bundt cakes here are very moist and the frosting is great. The service on the other hand needs improvement though. Upon walking in you are greeted but in a depressing manner. It seems as if the staff does not really want to be there and it is carried on to the customers unfortunately.Great cakes and not so great service. That's what to expect at this location."
Monica G.,5,"My review really has nothing to do with the cakes themselves... although they are pretty amazing!!!I wanted to review the girl who helped us today named Jen! What a total sweetheart she is!!!! I went in this afternoon with my girls to order a birthday cake for our late Grandfather and she was so helpful and kind even after I sorta lost it and started with the water works.She showed us the choices and when I didnt really find what I wanted she suggested to create our own and helped us make it exactly what he would of wanted!!! As sensitive as the subject was she went way above and beyond to make sure we were happy and satisfied with our choices. Not only did she make me feel better with our choices, she is also scheduled to bake the day of our pick up and told us that she is proud to make our cake and felt like ""part of the family!"" I can wait to see the final product knowing she will make it special for us!Thank you again Jen for everything!!!!!"
HotPot F.,3,"OVERALL RATING:Service: 3Decor: 4Food: 3Dog-friendly: NA--------------------------------------------------Plus (+):Tasting samples are nice a big:) The decor is cute. The door's sign says ""thanks a bundt"":) Minus (-):Wow, the service is S-LO-W  here...but they're really friendly. Prices are high. Maybe they use too much frosting...--------------------------------------------------I've heard that they use Dunkin Hines cake mix for their bundt cakes. If this is true, at least they use it well. These cakes were very moist and I liked the flavors. I had the Red Velvet and Carrot Cake. Don't think I'll go rushing back, but I can recommend it to cupcake lovers as a good alternative."
Zeny S.,5,"This is one of the most consistent bakeries in the valley.  Their bundt cakes are always moist and delicious.  And their cream cheese frosting is to die for!I came in today to redeem my free birthday bundlet and to purchase my husband's birthday cake.  Our favorites are their classics: marble, chocolate chocolate chip and red velvet.  I wish they made their raspberry one more often.  Customer service is always on par too!  Again with consistency, at both Las Vegas locations!Thank you for sharing your bundt cakes with our family!"
Louisa M.,4,"How can this place NOT put a smile on your face? You'll pay some serious $$ for a happy tummy but I think the quality of the product more than justifies the expense. I love to throw parties and I always pick up a dozen or so of their mini bundtinis (cute name, right?) and they are always devoured quickly into the evening. The presentation is so pretty and I love that the cakes are light on the frosting (so you don't get a sickly-sweet sugar bomb in every bite). This isn't your typical American style cake; check out the photos so you won't be disappointed. I would love one of these as my birthday cake, though. Great flavors, friendly employees, quality ingredients and a cute shop."
Billee T.,5,Mmmm MmMmM mmmm!!! I want one RIGHT NOW.. lol :)Discovered their cakes at a friends bday party. It was a seasonal fruit flavor I believe. YuM. Next experience was a cake that was at my work. Marble. Just as amazing. Theeeen I tried 2 more flavors at a little girls bday party where they had chocolate & red velvet..............................It was at that point I decided I was going to use this bakery for my wedding cake!!! So my husband & I.. (which was my fiance' at the time) went in & tried some flavors :)We decided on a large size red velvet for bottom & marble for medium size top. Then we got carrot cake for smaller size for topper to save in freezer :) And I choose to have them drizzle the cream cheese icing. This comes 2 tiered & with a choice of a themed decoration.. a flower.. a little sign.. etc. I chose to not have any of their decorations since I was decorating it myself using real orchids...  they may have taken the decoration cost off the cake price since I did not want the decorations.. can't remember.. lol. But this place is absolutely amazing.. their cakes are soo moist... the only icing they offer is cream cheese & thats because they were so careful in choosing a select number of cake flavors that go so well with cream cheese icing!!  JUST THE BEST EVER!!!
Sierra G.,5,Free samples! I was impressed that I already knew my order and told them my order and they still insisted that I try their samples (knowing I wouldn't be buying any more than what I already purchased). I got the little mini bundtlettes (something along those lines) and also had a BOGO from a newspaper coupon. So both cakes were only $3 - something. Pretty good deal for the quality you are getting.
Maria D.,3,"Definitely love the cake, no doubt, it's really good, hence the 3 star when it could've been a 2. They probably need to hire more cashiers because this location is always busy, at least when I go. I specifically ordered drizzle on my cake, but I got the signature. I didn't see it until I got home. I didn't want to argue with them and end up driving 20 minutes and wait another 15 minutes in line just to tell them I wanted drizzle icing. So, I'm home whining about it, because I can't do anything about it. Ugh. Why though? Why?"
Mary H.,1,Very upset today by the poor service received the manager and store clerk who could not locate my order and indirectly stated I must have ordered from the wrong store!  Which is incorrect seeing as I had spent  over $65 on two cakes two weeks prior. I would have not accepted the cake they all of a sudden found had it not been for a coworkers birthday.
Jen M.,5,"Duuuuuuuuuuude, this place is ReDonk!!  They must bake crack right into the batter because everything I've tasted is unreal!!  Carrot cake with the cream cheese frosting, to die for and the presentation is oober cute.But apparently the word is getting out, each time I've been in, there's been at least a 20 minute wait, Sh*t Balls!!  So order online!! They have a very small selection of merchandise which passes the time. Delish!"
Ivannia P.,5,"ordered the Red velvet Bundt cake for a get together and everybody was in love, now I have a couple of friends and family who are now going to try it themselves."
Chuck H.,4,"Presentation (check) Taste (check) Wow factor on a special day (check). I don't think I have tasted a cake from this place that wasn't absolutely flawless. Smooth all the way through and the frosting is world class. Order it, eat it, and you will want more,More,MORE. The only cake that I truly have a hard time sharing with others because it is that good."
Jocelyn L.,5,"I'm a HUGE fan!the 1st time i heard 'bundt cake', i thought- yuck. dense, dry. richSo i reluctantly got dragged into that place by my friend...but once i tried the sample...OH MY!The Choc Choc Chip was AMAZINGMoist, light, yummy and the frosting is SO GOOD!The pineapple upside down cake was pretty good too...but my fave is still the chocYUM YUM YUMLOV U!"
Anhdao D.,5,"When I first moved to Las Vegas, my girlfriends told me about one of their local favorites, Nothing Bundt Cake, with the same enthusiasm they would have about shoes and chocolate.  I admit, I had my doubts, ""bundt cakes?"" I thought, ""what can be so special about that?""Well, the bakery itself has cute decor, bright and cheery.  They often have samples of seasonal favorites for you to try, which is what I did first.  And it was truly love at first bite.  If you're looking for a light taste, this is not it.   These are not the $80 Steve Madden pumps you get at the outlet.  These are the $400 Manolo stilettos you get from Saks.  They are truly indulgent creatures: moist, rich, and sumptuously addictive.  But unlike the Manolos, they are inexpensive.The red velvet is the crowd's favorite, and it is undoubtedly mine also.  The cream cheese frosting is the best I've ever had.  There is a perfect amount of frosting on each cake: a foremost difference between bundt cakes and cupcakes.  All I can say is: once you go bundt, you can never go back."
Courtney M.,5,Cake Heaven in other words. Their 3 level mini bundt cake tower. WOW! !!!So many flavors of delicious goodness packed into more than deserving single servings. I closed my eyes and enjoyed every bite carefully as it was just that amazing. The staff are wonderful in helping to put together these beautiful gift towers that I got.  You have to definitely try this as it is one you won't regret...
Kimberly V.,5,This store is open on Sundays thank god. I forgot to order my daughters birthday cake . She loves the white chocolate raspberry cake . It's to die for!!!
Jessie B.,4,"You know the saying, the way to a man's heart is through his stomach? It's true about women too... at least some women, like me! I love sweets, a surefire way to make me your friend or cheer me up is to get me stuff that contains excessive amounts of sugar.  We have had a few cakes from Nothing Bundt Cakes sent to us at work, and they were always nice but they never really  blew me away. Then I realized why... No one had sent the right flavor! A girlfriend gave me a one of the cute little bundtlets for my birthday... It was White Chocolate Raspberry and it was, in a word, the bomb.The bundtlets are considered a single serving but it was so rich and tasty that I had to share with my husband. At $3.99 a piece, these are a much better deal then the fancy cupcakes being sold for $3 around the corner..."
Karen Jane M.,4,"This place wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be.  Ok, I've been having an obsession over red velvet, ever since I ate the red velvet cupcake from Sprinkles.  Now I'm in a constant search for something similar to it, so far no luck.  Nothing Bundt cake has an incredible selection of goods.  I love the smell I encounter once I walk in, it smells like goody heaven! I also do love how they have samples of their cakes, nothing beats trying free things! FREE, is the secret word for me! I've never really had a good bundt cake, but I'd say that this place is very legit.  The consistency of the cake is very good, and so is the texture.  I love their red velvet one, the cream isn't too sweet and the cake doesn't crumble at your touch.  It's equally right.  I would like to try the other flavors they have, I think I read something vanilla? OoOoo, I'm liking the sound of that already!"
Regina C.,5,"After I went to the gym and did very well at a Mexican restaurant (ate the good, not the unhealthy), I remembered that I had a groupon and I wanted to use it...Since I've been so good, I should reward myself right?  After all, what is life without eating what you love?  Nothing BUNDT Cake.We drove to Nothing Bundt Cake, show the super nice lady in front my groupon on my iPhone (yes people, I am going green so I didn't print out any of the groupon, and you shouldn't either!).  I told her I am just getting the bundletts and I grabbed 3 lemon, 1 cinnamon, and 1 red velvet.  As you all can tell here, lemon is my FAVORITE!!!  However, just a quick note, they all taste very delicious, but one will stand out depending on your preference.The cake texture is what blew me away.  So moist and soft that it's as if you are eating a blissful cloud (well, I am super happy while I eat the cake).  The cream cheese icing complements the cake so well.  It's a perfect balance.  I usually have this with a glass of milk and I am in heaven.  I am definitely watching what I eat, but I do not hesitate when it comes to Nothing Bundt Cake.I got home from Half Shell yesterday, kinda tired, but when I opened up my fridge and see my bag of bundletts, I grabbed the lemon one.  I was only going to eat half, but I finished it.  It was that good.    After I finish working on one of my assignment this morning, I will reward myself with a velvet cake. Thank God for Nothing Bundt Cake!!!"
Brenda B.,5,"AMAZING...that's what I have to say...The Carrot cake with the cream cheese frosting, OMGosh to die for. It sure didn't last at the party I took it to and it looks super cool. I did spruce it up a bit by putting a tiny vase of flowers in it's hole, very cool.Ordering online, or phone in your order cause it's SUPER busy and the wait is maybe 20 minutes!! But it's Soooooo worth it! Enjoy"
Chrystee Y.,5,"This quaint little shop blows me away! Almost every birthday I've had for the last five years, I've gotten 4 little bundt cakes each year and they are moist and delicious!!! I highly recommend this shop!"
Jay J.,5,"Awsome, the best place ever!  I'm  not a big desert person, but OMG! This is a desert that is hard to resist! The cakes are always moist!  If you know you want one during holidays, you better order it!  Or you get what they have."
Ritu K.,4,"The super friendly employee sold me on the chocolate chocolate chip mini bundt (really how could I refuse double chocolate). It was a nice moist chocolate cake, but I have to say I was a bit disappointed and here's why. My friend used to make the most amazing chocolate chocolate chip bundt cake, and thus, I'm totally spoiled. To me a bundt cake should be very moist and dense. This cake was just too light and airy. It may be the mini size, and perhaps ordering the larger size would give me that dense bundt cake fix. There's three different sizes to pick from (little mini cakes sold by the dozen, a smaller individual bundt- I made this one last for days, and of course the big ass bundt cake..). I guess its a nice change from a typical cake."
Rachel L.,5,"As soon as you walk into the bakery you immediately begin to salivate from the sweet rich smell of the bundt cakes. What I love about this place is all the different variety of flavors and sizes that the cakes come in. They have a large size, a medium size, a small individual size called ""bundt-lets"" and then a even smaller snack size called ""bundtinis."" You have to buy bundtinis buy the dozen which run about $16.50 and you can only get those in 4 flavors: Chocolate, pumpkin, red velvet, and white chocolate raspberry. I've tried all four of these flavors and each one was DELICIOUS. I couldn't make up my mind which one was my favorite! The other sizes were also pretty reasonably priced and they come in other flavors too, like lemon, carrot cake, etc. The cake texture itself was to die for! The cake was moist and soft and not too dense. There wasn't too much icing which was perfect and the icing wasn't too sweet either. They also take phone orders so they can make your cake fresh for whatever occasion! Just simply AWESOME! I'm already planning my next trip back to try the other flavors!!"
Jade B.,5,Delicious desserts and good customer service. All the flavors are to die for. Especially the strawberries and cream.
Cheryl L.,5,"I beyond love this place.  Every cake i've gotten, everyone raves about it-- it really doesn't do it justice if you don't get it fully decorated, (I never have), but they are beautiful if you do. I usually get it for our house, so there's not a need to pay the extra.  The taste and quality of the cakes are out of this world. I love the red velvet- they have little chocolate chips inside! Moist and yummy... And I haven't seen it yet, but in the fall, there is usually the Pineapple Upside Down bundt. I hope that NBC still makes this one, not just pumpkin! :)My all time favorite is the White Chocolate Raspberry. Definitely a must. Service was good- be sure to order ahead of time if you know what you want, they do run out of the 8"" bundt cakes and the larger ones. They do have more of the bundtletts (individual ones) but for some reason, the larger cakes are better to me. I think it's because they don't dry out like the bundtletts do since they are smaller."
Jana C.,5,"I love nothing bundt. Love the cupcakes,bundtinis,bundtlets. I love the employees too. They are all nice and sweet to customers. I love getting birthday freebies. That's why. I'm passing on my nothing bundt love to my daughter. Hoho."
Aleshia M.,5,"Best cake ever! Super moist and delicious every time. Every flavor is delicious, especially red velvet. I would recommend calling ahead to order or make sure the flavor you would like is available. They also offer cute cake decorating supplies."
Tricia M.,4,"This is very very good, but not perfect for me because of the expense.  I bought a regular size cake for my husband for around $20.  I've only had the chocolate, but one day I will try the others.  The cake itself was extremely moist, and the cream cheese frosting is sinfully good.Even though this is pricey I would go here over the cupcakery."
Michelle S.,5,I Absolutely Love Nothing Bundt Cakes! I get them every holiday I Love mostly every flavor! And I also get them for family and friends Birthdays they add really cute things to There Cakes Highly Recommended
Janelle B.,5,I'm in love with the red velvet bundtinis!! The cake is so soft and the cream cheese icing is perfect. I picked up a box to take to a dinner with friends and had to get one for myself too. These are my new favorite! The girls are the store were very friendly and answered all my questions.
Angeline R.,5,"I have a weak spot for the combination of red velvet and cream cheese frosting, and let me tell you, Nothing Bundt Cakes does it right. Their cakes are very moist and leave an unforgettable taste that leaves you wanting more.  The cream cheese frosting perfectly complements the cake without taking away from the original cake flavor. One of the great ordering features they offer has to do with the delicious frosting. Nothing Bundt Cakes gives the option of drizzling the frosting (for those who prefer a lighter dose of deliciousness) or the signature frosting (for those who enjoy having a heavy dose of cream cheese goodness). Just thinking about the cakes and the frosting is making me want to order one right now.."
Allison J.,5,Yes... Yes.... YESSSSSS!!Lemon chocolate chip... Plain ol' lemon.... the marble bundt.... OH MAN!YESSSSSS!!
Clayton K.,5,"Cream Cheese Frosting. The best Cream Cheese frosting. Thick, sweet and rich, but not too thick, not too sweet, and not too rich. They put it on every cake, and it goes on every single cake. They don't even put it on the whole cake, and normally this would be utter horseshit, but you don't care, just because you want that frosting that is there! And somehow it balances the cake out. It's just... frosting. Glorious amazing frosting.There's other stuff I might mention too: the little cakes are a really good size and make for a handy just-under-twenty dollar gift that's good for all occasions. The shop itself is very nice and has these delightful cakes ready. Bigger ones are just under thirty. They have bundlets for the standard wallet killing markup. One warning: sometimes, just sometimes, you get a cake that is near frozen solid. The ones in the back of the fridge I guess, and they still taste great when they thaw, but if you're planning on eating immediately, check for this.These are the only good bundt cakes. Proof that a successful business can come from a stupid idea if you sneak a little crystal meth into your frosting and do it with some style. At least that's my guess."
Elizabeth T.,4,"There Bundt cakes are perfection. I've given them to friends, had them several times at my office, and given them to clients. Everybody loves them! I have a little bit of trouble finding my order once, but other than that great service all around."
Robin W.,5,"I always get excited when I can find a excuse to go to nothing bundt cakes. The store is adorable, the staff is so nice, and the cakes are so moist and perfect. The most recent cake was my first to get decorated and it was wonderful. Between four people, we ate it in one sitting."
Kristina M.,5,I went to pick up my daughters cake that I pre ordered for her 13 th birthday. They messed up the order and said I would have to wait 30 minutes for them to fix it. I noticed they had a free bundtlet for birthdays so I asked to get her one and she asked for my ID. I said she's 13 so she said well then nothing. HORRIBLE  CUSTOMER SERVICE initially. I went back in and explained  the situation and manager took care of it promptly. It's not the initial issue but how it's handled when a customer says wait this isn't ok.
Melani A.,5,Awsome....I recieved one as a Christmas Gift from my accountant... it was amazing... I will definatly get one for my self next time around... Cream cheese frosting was almost better than the moist chocolate cake. It's almost too bad they have a hole in the middle...
Beau C.,5,"Three words...white...chocolate...rasberry. Remember them, use them. Forget about cupcakes, go for the bundt. Nothing else to say."
Eduardo S.,3,"The cakes are good, but their customer services over the phone is horrible....."
Leizel Y.,5,"So... yea.... I'm totally a cake person.  THIS stuff right here is just.... BOMB!!! VERY moist & spongy.  Cake itself isn't TOO sweet.  Cream cheese frosting isn't too sweet either.  So it's just SUPER YUMMY goodness!!!! MUST TRY!! A lil pricey BUT it's worth it.  Great for special occasions where they can decorate it or not, whichever you choose.  They also have bundtini's! Cute lil bundt cakes. My fav flavors... red velvet and marble.  I have yet to try other flavors.  The bakery is clean.  Workers are very nice.  Packaging is done very well. If you haven't tried it... JUST TRY IT! It's GOOOOOOD.... =)"
Roman C.,2,"Nothing special, overpriced, they have good frosting if that's what you call it. When I walked in two staff members didn't great me and when I finally got a bite in wasn't impressedJust a Famous name here folks"
Jennifer M.,5,The red velvet is to die for !! I love big BUNDTS and i can not LIE!
Selena P.,5,"I gave this place 5 stars not only because of their awesome customer service, but their amazing bundt cake! I tried to online order a cake less than 24 hours before my moms birthday and it wasn't letting me, so I contacted the store and the wonderful woman on the phone told me it was no problem. She was nice, courteous and represented the store well. Once we received the cake the presentation was beautiful and it tasted great. The frosting was the best part personally. This place is a great place that I would recommend in place of any birthday cake. :)"
Miss D.,5,Love this place! It's our go to for all work and personal birthday celebrations! It's so moist and delicious every person in my family loves a different flavor from white chocolate raspberry to red velvet to chocolate and lemon! Every flavor is so delicious!
John H.,4,"After a disappointing meal two doors down walked in here on a whim.  Staff greeted us immediately and were very pleasant, there is a broad range of flavors and sizes, and while in the store I sampled peanut butter chip and it is marvelous.  Brought home four of the small size cakes and could not be happier.  Recommend this place to everyone wanting flavorful moist bundt cake."
Rachel C.,5,"Simply delicious. So moist and so good....The icing on top is just enough (can be a little sweet). I tasted the chocolate chocolate chip and the flavor of the month (Red Velvet Cake!) SOOOO YUMMY! I can't explain how good the cakes are. You have to try it yourself! The bundlets are so cute too (serves 1, $3.99 each). They even make bigger versions, and the bigger ones get decorated with big artificial flowers. I'm not a huge fan of cake, but if I were to get one, it would definitely be at bundt cake at Nothing Bundt Cakes. *The owner was actually at the store, and she informed us that she is going to open a store in Utah. Business is obviously doing well!"
Morgan H.,4,"Yum! This is my go to cake place for B-days, special occasions, and when I just want an awesome treat. :) The full cakes come in different sizes or even tiered.They also offer ""bundtlets"" which are mini cakes and ""bundtinis"" which are bite sized. My favorite flavor is the red velvet, which also has chocolate chips in it! This place makes my absolute favorite red velvet cake, if you're getting me cake, don't bother getting it anywhere else! The cream cheese frosting on it is also my favorite, combining together to make my idea of bundt cake perfection. To order you can call, walk in, or order online - very convenient. I believe they do home deliveries as well. The cakes are lovely on their own but they do decorate them too! There are several different themes you can choose from, basically they decorate it with faux flowers, personalized cards, crowns, birthday hats etc. depending on what you choose! Overall, this is going to be pricey, especially compared to a grocery store bakery, but you get what you pay for!"
Michael P.,4,A bundt cake was a previously unknown piece of food to me before this wonderful store too life over five years ago.  Their chocolate cakes are amazing and I highly recommend them to anyone who loves sweets.Service is fast and friendly Place is an established neighborhood stapleCakes taste amazing
Stacia J.,4,Nothing Bundt Cakes is sooo cute!!  My friend got my Birthday cake here and it was absolutely the best red velvet cake I have ever had-SOOOO YUMMY.Since I loved my super cute cake I just had to get my next cake here.  I called and made an order for a Halloween cake and decided to try a vanilla cake this time with some festive Halloween decorations.  I went to pick up the cake and the staff was super friendly and the cake was perfect.  I would suggest this place to everyone and can't wait for the next special occasion that calls for another cake =)
Christina D.,5,"What can I say that hasn't already been said. Phenomenal cake! They have some secret recipe for moistness because I've never had better.Red Velvet & Praline pecan are my faves.They have seasonal pumpkin that is so yummy, delicate pumpkin flavor, not too much spice but a light, yet decadent taste. Of course the cream cheese is the bomb.Highly recommend !!"
Jennifer P.,5,"This place is always a sweet treat! There isn't a flavor I haven't liked! I love the bundtlets, they are a great sharing size.... unless you are having an extra sweet day and want one all to yourself!"
Jennifer N.,1,This store was not accommodating or helpful. I was there at 5:59 and wanted a simple order. The man rudely said he was closed. They lost my business and luckily there are many other cupcake bakeries which I will now take my business to.
Eunice V. K.,5,"Another thank you goes to Jeff...  You sure know how to get to a girl's heart, at least this one's...  Through my stomach!  :  Though I am still having a difficult time in deciding whether I like bundt cakes or cupcakes better, they are both delicious!  The cakes here are so soft and moist!  The frosting can be lightened up a bit, but still good with the current amount.  The store has a website and will ship nationwide!  This is a cakery that one must try at least once!  My daughter sister and I, all loved the red velvet, lemon, and white chocolate cakes.  Give Nothing Bundt Cakes a try, as you will not be let down!"
AnnaBelle J.,5,This is my go to place when I'm craving a sweet tooth. The staff is always fast with our orders . Every flavor of cake is moist and fresh. I love the seasonal flavors but my absolute favorite has to be the red velvet. I normally order little bundlets for my coworkers and they're gone within minutes. I know they're a lot of locations in the valley but this is the one I go to because they're fast and friendly. Super helpful too!
Nicole M.,5,Our Youth Football Team did a fundraiser with them & the experience was by far the BEST! Even with our large order they made the process smooth! Everything was DELICIOUS! I highly recommend them!
C D.,1,Please be careful when you shop here.  I have had good experiences but when you have a bad experience this Nothing Bundt Cakes will not help you with it.  I was completely ignored.  I have left several messages and Sent emails.  I contacted corporate and they have forwarded it to the owners.  I never heard from anyone and this happened back in January.  4 months.  At this point I am more annoyed by the response then the simple issue that could have been resolved quickly if handled.  Unacceptable follow thru. Sad to see as I know this does not reflect on other locations.  Please shop at another Location.
Larry G.,5,This place fabulous! Scrumptiously delicious desserts! Great for special occasions! What a way to show others appreciation!
M W.,5,"This place rocks, I wanted to find a good bakery and found them on Yelp. Thanks for the good reviews. It was like walking into a sweet fantasy. They had a sample of the pecan praline, and I couldn't stop grabbing the samples Yum! Getting ready to hit them up again today before I head back home.."
Felicia P.,1,"If there was a zero star I would give it. They may have great cakes but after the fourth time ordering online, they didn't have our order for my grandsons birthday cake who is visiting from out of state. I thought the last three times I had tried to order online and the orders weren't there might have been a fluke and maybe they had improved their online order service, so I gave them chance after chance. The lines are way too long to order, and just as long to pick up the order. It takes an average of seven minutes to get somebody to answer the phone when on hold. Finally I was told I'd get a refund to my credit card and was sent a receipt via email from the manager. No apology, no explanation, no commitment to try and improve their horrible customer service. They aren't worth the aggravation - I am furious right now. They will never see another dime. Greed doesn't make for good business."
Corina C.,5,This cakes are amazingggg the staff is super friendly definitely recommend coming here  you have to try the rasberry white cake so deliciouss!!!
Laurie M.,5,"Ok, my hubby and I got the lemon at the food fest, and we both agree that it was in the top five cakes we have ever had, and we eat a lot of cake!!! Can't wait to try the other flavors, Yummy.Just worth mentioning, it sat in our truck for hours before we ate it, wow!!"
Jen G.,5,"Ordered a full sized red velvet bundt cake a few days before I needed it for my sister's birthday. This was the first time I had placed an order instead of walking into the store and choosing the smaller bundlets. Picked up the cake at the arranged time, and was amazed to see how pretty the birthday theme decorations looked.  The cake was moist and delicious as always, and the cream cheese frosting never disappoints. We have tried the chocolate chocolate, the white cake, chocolate raspberry, lemon and red velvet. There is no flavor that we have not enjoyed. The employees are always friendly and helpful, and there are usually samples displayed at the store."
Hope S.,4,"Okay, I've been to this location on several occasions and the cakes/ cupcakes are amazing!!!! I didn't give a review right away because my first trip was on Easter and it was too crazy busy to fairly review. On my second visit I was told I had to pay extra for a card on my second box of cupcakes because they were customized and they had already given me a card on the variety cupcake box. However, upon returning today and ordering a customized box of cupcakes I was given the little card. So.... I don't think that was accurate and consistent. Therefore, I had to take away 1 star for customer service. Most people there are extremely friendly. Love this place!"
Xochitl T.,5,We have been in Vegas for three years and that's all we buy for birthdays!! So moist and delicious and never disappoint. We placed a order for delivery and they don't guarantee a time but they went out there way to make we got our Order on time. Thank you so much for that and the delicious bundt cake!!!
Rngox A.,2,"I would have given them a 5 star rating since I never had problems with the product or service before, but this takes the cake.I walked in to purchase a bundt cake for a special occasion. I purchase the birthday 10 inch bundt cake. The person who took my order told me it would take 10 to 15minutes to have my order ready. I said that's fine (5:45pm). The two customers behind me ordered the same thing except the 8 inch cakes. So we are all waiting. 10minutes later, first customer behind me gets her cake. Okay, I'm thinking, maybe they have two decorators doing the job. Her's was smaller. Another 10minutes, the second customer behind me gets her cake. Remind you, I ordered before BOTH of them. I was not happy. I expressed to the person who took my order what was the status my cake. She goes back like she had no clue what was happening. Didn't even apologize. Five minutes later, she says they are working on it right now. Than I asked to speak to a manager who happened to be right there while all this was happening. Her excuse was that I got a bigger cake than the two customers and the frosting needed to set longer. Honestly, that was BS. Meanwhile, I waited 30 MINUTES for my cake. I left that place at 6:17pm. Jori, the manager did nothing at all to compensate. Not even an APOLOGY! At least they could have apologized for the mistake they made.So, at the end of this, I just want the public to know, there is no sincerity of good customer service at this establishment. I felt they are all nice when everything is well, but if there was customer service issue that arise, they don't know how to deal with it. I felt a little discriminated and I hope the owners of the place read this. I love their cakes, but not enough for this place to get my business. I will go elsewhere."
Jennielyn D.,3,"Why call in an order when it is never ready or right when I pick it up?! The cake is delicious, but the last 3 times I placed an order, twice I had to wait 30 min because it wasn't ready and once they lost my order completely! Great taste, but horrible service."
Miber J.,5,"Addictive, dangerously delicious and not that pricey=love. A client brought some to us one day at work,  and i took one home for my husband,  but i ate it. That's how crazy good these are. Every single flavor is my favorite."
Christal H.,4,"Update: A month after the incident, the Manager of the location, Jori, requested to contact me through Yelp. We exchanged emails and we both explained the situation further. With more understanding on both ends, Jori has offered to make things better and send a bundt cake out of town for the person who never received theirs, and offered to give one to me as well, for my troubles. I really appreciate and respect Jori for reaching out to me and listening to my concerns, that is the great customer service I have come to know from this company in the past! At no point did Jori ever ask that I update my review, I figure it is the right thing to do because they went out of their way to earn back my business and I can appreciate that."
Jazmine E.,1,Cashier had an attitude didn't care to service me until I decided to try a sample then she was all over me like grease in a fire. She threw away my receipt and then after asked if I wanted it. Smh what great customer service.
Kyle Z.,5,"They are always ready to help even if you haven't order ahead.  Of course the cakes are just plain old great, but the best part of this store is that it is open on Sunday making last minute ideas work out.  I've also never had poor service from the 'kids' working the counter. they all seen to really like being there.  I highly recommend."
Melissa S.,4,Yummy bundt cakes.. recommended for sure.. raspberry swirl is the best fast service and very friendly they are always offering samples to try as well.
Jeric R.,4,"This is place is becoming my regular to go for getting quick and easy and delicious cakes. They have a whole wide variety of flavors to choose from, and I myself loves the raspberry white chocolate. I would call in first and see what they have available to purchase as sometimes they do not have available cakes to buy right away, usually they get so busy that you need to request for a cake by calling and reserving and picking it up later. Price is good and staff is nice and friendly."
Greg S.,5,Had a nice variety pack of bundt cakes dropped off at the office today.  One of my favorite desserts in town!It's hard to say which flavor i like the best as they are all so good.
Jules S.,2,I love the cakes and this location is closest to me so I go here. To walk in and buy a bundt cake is usually pretty easy. But this time it was very disappointing. I was told it would take 15 minutes and 25 minutes later I'm told it's 3 more minutes. It's disappointing because this whole time the supervisor or manager on duty is standing in the middle of the store chit chatting with his friends. Must be nice to be hand delivered a dozen of bundts from your friend that works their while your customers are still waiting for their own order! Be courteous to your customers!
Juli E.,5,"These bundt cakes are amazing! I ordered 100 individual bundt cakes last year and the year before for my boss to give to co-workers. Today I picked up a dozen Bundtini's for a dinner party. They are moist, wide variety of flavors - all fantastic!, and nice creamy icing - not too sugary sweet. The line was almost out the door when I was there today early afternoon. The best dessert for any party, or your own splurge! Don't forget to get your sample when you arrive."
Sharlene B.,5,Great service and always moist and flavorful cakes no matter what flavor. I tried the seasonal flavor which was the peanut butter chocolate chip and this is by far my favorite. I'll be sad when it leaves the menu. I arrived close to closing time and the staff was still welcoming and did not rush me.
Victor G.,5,These cakes are always a hit among family and friends.  love the seasonal pumpkin bundt cask around the holidays but white chocolate is up there as well.  Yum!!
Brienna V.,4,"If someone gave me one tiny cake a day, I would be okay with the inevitable diabetes. The cakes are too delicious to deny!"
Virginia D.,4,Cakes are amazing...they need to switch up decorations since I am running out of choices for birthdays.  Would give 5 star if staff paid better attention to orders.  Messed up for the third time in a row.  Check your order BEFORE you leave the store.
Alison E.,2,So upset about the service today - I have never been treated like I was an annoyance when trying to buy a cake for my husbands birthday - hopefully they will give some training to their team on basic manners.
David C.,5,This place is good.  They wrapped the cake and made it look super presentable. I just walked in. Grabbed it and left. So easy. And so tasty!!!
Bianca O.,2,"Ordered a decorated Bundt cake from here yesterday, I asked for pick up at 2pm & they said they could do that! I got there to pick up at 2:15 (15 minutes later than original pick up time). The cake was not done & they let me know it'd be another 25-30 minutes. I was very irritated about that since that means it would be done almost 45 minutes later than the original time it was suppose to be ready. I asked the cashier if they had a cake ready that was undecorated & if I could have the decorations on the side since I had already paid for it. I needed the cake fast for my moms birthday. She ended up putting a cake in a box & told me I'd need to wait 8-10 minutes more for the decorations to be put in a bag. I am still very upset. If you're asking for a customer phone number when they place the order have the decency to call the customer to let them know, not when they arrive. Not to mention she wasn't the nicest but whatever the cake not being ready on time is what Im most upset about since I ended up showing up with an unfinished cake late."
Samantha K.,5,"I can honestly say that when it comes to bundt cakes, this place is the place to go.  They know what they are good at and even I couldn't stop eating the Carrot Cake Bundtlet that we got.  I limit my carbs and sugar on a daily basis...but the day I had this, I actually lost all self control and blew my diet.  And I NEVER blow my diet! It was that good. I have had their Red Velvet before as well...and it's also pretty fantastic!"
Miren H.,5,Was awesome! They had great service and was very helpful! I ordered their bundtinis and are delicious. A little pricey but worth it.
Frankie M.,2,First time at this location and last time.. I usually go to the summerlin location where you walk in and out no wait no hassle... This location is a 20min wait on all orders big or small. So inconvenient!!
Rick C.,1,"My favorite cake, unfortunately cashier on duty with blond curly hair very rude. She will great Caucasian customers only like her.  Poor customer service"
Teena N.,3,"With only 2 people man-ing the front, the wait is pretty long when it was only 2 people ahead of you.  Giving it 3 stars because the cakes are that good!"
Liz V.,5,This is the best cake and icing I have ever had! I am so addicted I have tried all the flavors and they are all good but the best is the gluten free chocolate chip.  Staff is great too. Come here and get your bundt cakes and you won't be disappointed!
Nathalie C.,5,"I have ordered from this location twice. It is the closest location to some relatives that live in Las Vegas and I am located in California. Although my order  was messed up twice, I still give them five stars because of their customer service and because of the product. I had been chatting with the company on Twitter, but decided to call the location to speak to someone about the mistake. Jori answered my call and took care of it. I would definitely order and visit this location because they are extremely helpful and polite."
C W.,5,The best cakes and reasonable prices too.  Every flavor I've tried has been delicious!
Kindra F.,5,"So Yummy!! We had a fail for my sons birthday cake, so after work I stopped and picked up some buntinis (I think that's what they're called), and they were delicious! I really like the new gingerbread flavor they have."
Melinda R.,5,I can come here twice a week lol. I love the mini cakes with a Thai tea bobba on the side (their neighbor).
Kelly F.,5,"Walked in the store as a first time customer and was treated so well! The young man at the counter was so sweet and friendly. Tasted a chocolate chip bundt sample and it was delicious. I bought red velvet, lemon and pecan praline. Moist, delicious goodness!! The icing is delectable! Will return and recommend!"
Mario S.,5,"If you ever are on Eastern, you must stop and get SOMETHING.  Even if it's a lil Bundtlette.  The minute you walk in, you are greeted with free samples and have the option to sample any other flavor.  You can't really go wrong with any flavors, but we love the cinnamon swirl and the white choc. raspberry.  Gotta try em all!"
April D.,5,"Love these cakes, my favorite is probably White Chocolate Raspberry but they are all wonderful. The only place I actually eat all of the icing off my cake. Staff is always so pleasant, I would be too if I worked around cake all day!"
Blair B.,5,"Forget cupcakes, bundt cakes are where it's at ! I used these for my wedding favors and they were a huge hit. They are a nice size (suitable for sharing) and come in so many delectable flavors. My favorite is the red velvet, but marble and carrot are also fabulous! These stay moist for a few days and the icing/cake ratio is just right. Service was great (everything was ready on time!) when I placed a big order."
Liz T.,5,"OMG...I've never had bundt cake like this, MUST try!  I stumbled upon this store by accident...my friend and I were going to Target and we were in search of cake, since we rejected a cupcake store just earlier and were going to go to search for cake after Target, but thank goodness I found this cute store.  I was kind of skeptic since I'm not a big bundt cake fan, but I figured it wouldn't hurt to check it out.  They had samples of red velvet cake and I immediately fell in love.  My friend who doesn't like red velvet even enjoyed the cake.  There were pieces of chocolate in the ever so moist cake and my friend and I knew this is it.  We bought the mini-bundts: marble, red-velvet, chocolate, white raspberry, and carrot.  I was expecting them to not taste as good as the samples since a lot of times the miniture version doesn't live up to the larger scale of cake, but I was wrong...when I took a bite I was so completely satisfied that my friend and I decided on Nothing Bundt Cakes.  The cakes do not have fancy decorations, but definitely yummy, hope you have a wonderful experience too!"
Keith A.,3,"after a nice lunch at matteo's, had a meeting with a local realtor.  decided to be a nice guy and bring a couple mini-bundt cakes from Nothing Bundt Cakes.ordered the white chocolate raspberry and the red velvet.  they are softball sized.  cost a little under $4 each.both cakes, very moist.  the red velvet cake, a little on the bitter side.  the raspberry - basic white cake with pieces of raspberry  - nice taste.  the frostings ( cream cheese and white chocolate ) both were good.  might be a little on the sweet side for some, but i liked it.nice place to go to when you want a treat."
Ashley J.,5,"Ordered a red velvet ""celebunting you"" cake day-of for my friends 28th birthday. All the girls who were here for the party flew or drove in from out of town and I was so surprised that they could make what we were looking for a decorate in just 6 hours! Ordering was super easy and so was the pick up process. The cake was delicious and so was that yummy frosting. I'll be back to check out the carrot cake next time! Thank you for a wonderful experience!"
Paul W.,4,"Rolled in looking for a birthday cake substitute and did we ever find it.Settled on a ten inch Marble cake as it was readily available.  They could have prepped another cake but the turn around time was twenty minutes.  I thought I would ask if they wrote anything on the cake such as Happy Birthday and they do not.  As I stare at the cakes on the Yelp page, I see just what a silly request this was.Out the door with a yummy bundt cake in a very nice looking box.The cake eaten later on in the evening was moist and absolutely delicious."
Melanie S.,5,"Nothing Bundt Cakes!  Yum!!!I am a frequent buyer of NBC :)From Birthday cakes, baby showers, bridal showers, holiday cakes (the Easter Cake decor is adorable!!!) I also buy the Bundtlets for my son to give his teachers at the end of the year and they make great Boss' Day gifts too!So many different flavors ~ Chocolate Chip, Red Velvet (has little chocolate chips inside), Lemon, Marble, Carrott, the list goes on and on! My favorite is Cinnamon Swirl.If you are looking for something to bring to a party or work gathering this will truly be a hit!I love the way you can choose the decorations for the cake and the packaging is so beautiful you feel bad opening it but that goes away quickly after the first bite!"
Eli W.,5,"I came in looking for a small cake for a coworker's birthday. Emily helped me pick out a cake based on my coworker's personality because I wasn't sure what she would've liked - special type of service right there - and she suggested the Cinnamon Swirl bundlet. I had already been eyeing it so Emily's suggestion pushed me over the fence. Drew checked me out in a friendly and efficient manner. Even though I didn't opt for a bow or any decoration, Emily placed the cake and a fork inside a bag and sealed it with a Nothing Bundt Cakes sticker, which I found to be helpful in the presentation since I was planning on giving it to my coworker that night. The cake itself was well done, moist and frosted with care, nothing sloppy. I appreciate the service from here and I most likely will return. Thanks, Emily!"
Jenny P.,4,"First time here.... Stopped because it was next to the boba shop. Everyone was so nice, welcomed us in and talked to us for a lil bit. We tried the pumpkin spice sample & loved it! So we got a small one Togo to enjoy on our flight home & they as we were going to pay, they said ""it's on us""... What a nice treat! Thanks nothing bundt cakes!  We will surely enjoy our flight home!"
Jamie P.,5,"Best. Cake. Ever. Frosting should be sold separately so I can eat it with a spoon lol. I absolutely love the cakes here. They are moist and flavorful and the frosting is the icing on the cake, literally! They have different cake flavors, but only one frosting flavor which is cream cheese. Whenever someone suggests getting a cake for a special occasion, I always suggest NBC. They are kinda pricey, but so worth it! They also sell lil' mini bundt cakes that you can buy at the store, so you can try all the different flavors without spending a ton of money!"
Haley L.,5,"the ONLY cake I want for my birthday's!! Soooooooo delicious. My two favorites are the Red velvet and white chocolate raspberry. Always so soft and moist, consistently delicious at all the locations. They can do cute little decorations based on what the event or theme might be as well so thats an added plus. HIGHLY recommend this place!!"
Cindy J.,5,"Love love love their cakes. My son loves the lemon! Me, love them all but most favorite is the red velvet.  OMG AMAZING!"
Kamille W.,5,"Fabulous customer service and equally great tasting cakes!!! The only thing I'd like is if they had all their flavors readily available ans not have to order some if your favourite isn't already made.  So, as customer, call ahead and order...then, enjoy your awesome best cake ever and interacting with their exceptional staff!  :)"
Yvette W.,5,"Absolutely AMAZING! I received a coupon for a FREE bundtlet at a cupcake battle and I thought it would be a tiny little thing. Since my daughter works in the same area I figured we may as well get the freebie. Boy, am I glad I went in. These little cakes are to die for! I sampled three different cupcake  bakery's treats at the expo and I didn't actually remember this place as standing out. But let me tell you, those cakes looked so good and the sample I tried...well, I took my free cake and bought two others! My personal favorite has always been carrot cake, so I got that one for me. Their cream cheese frosting was out of this world. Not too rich, not too sweet...just perfect! The lemon cake my oldest daughter had and the red velvet my youngest had were both also amazing! The little chocolate chips in the red velvet were a great treat and the frosting on the lemon was also delicious. All of the cakes were moist and tasty! I just heard that in the fall they have pineapple upside down cake! I can't wait! That is the best and my kids don't like it! HAHA ALL FOR ME!And they have a location in Vegas which is much closer to my house, so I guess I can just go eat bundt cakes anytime I want! So much for my diet!"
Mat J.,5,"I really don't like red velvet cake, but I have to admit that the red velvet here is pretty damn good! My favorite cake here is still the marble, but they really don't do anything bad! The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is... ok, I changed it to 5 stars... its that good!"
AJ D.,5,"Cake never tasted so good. I get either the Red Velvet or the Marble. I've also tried the Carrot, but i've had better elsewhere. The cream cheese topping they use is like crack. If you eat their cake once, you'll be hooked for life. They even have little ""bundlette"" cakes which are meant to be single servings for about $5 a pop."
Desirae C.,5,"Absolutely delicious! My husband brought one home for me one day, I'd never had it. Omg, I felt like licking the container."
Brad T.,5,"First off I don't really care for cake. Give the choice between pie and cake, I always take pie. However, something about these moist, sweet, delicious icing topped cakes keep me coming back for more. While many people have been eating and celebrating with Nothing Bunt Cakes for years now, only recently did I get hooked on them and boy are they good. My personal favorites are the lemon and white chocolate ones. Add on top of it all the icing and I am in pig heaven. So for my birthday now, I am happy with both ice cream pies and Nothing Bunt Cakes."
Mikala S.,5,My favorite is Cinnamon Swirl. Marble and Chocolate Chocolate Chip. The cake is scrumptious and the frosting is the best part of the cakes...superb!!!!
Sunny G.,5,"The best bundt cakes ever!  My fav is the red velvet w/ chocolate chips, seriously addictive.  They offer a few different sizes ( Bundtlets for $3.99, perfect if you just want one serving for yourself, 8 inch for $18.50 serves about 6-8, 10 inch for $29.50 serves about 12+ and bundtini's, bite size bundt cakes like mini cupcakes by the dozen for $16.50, .  I stopped in a few days ago and picked up 2 dozen bundtini's (Red Velvet, Chocolate Chocolate Chip & White Chocolate) for a New Year's party, ran me $33.  They were a hit!  (I called in and ordered my bundtini's and they were ready within a half hour, super convenient)  Awesome bakery w/ the best customer service."
Daette L.,5,The cakes are so moist and delicious. Great staff. Clean bakery.
Holly D.,5,"AMAZING!  I've had the pumpkin and red velvet, both are so good.  The pumpkin is my favorite.  This place has become my favorite dessert place.  Great for gifts and parties too."
Rea I.,5,"i've never tasted a bundt cake this good before! I'm so undecisive when it comes to bundt cakes, because some are just so gross, especially the store bought ones! But these are AMAZING.... I, myself am not a cake, or sweets in general kind of person. I went here w/ my sister and got the sample of the peanut butter one which I WILL get next time. But for this visit I got the red velvet, and oh my gosh I've never tasted anything SO MOIST, and actually taste like how a bundt cake is supposed to! The cream cheese frosting is perfect. After a while though, it will get sweet but its normal because thats just how sweet things are. All the staff members are nice, the ambiance is nice, and the place is small but comfy. I'm definitley coming back and trying the other flavors. And if you're looking for it, its kind of hidden. Its next to No. 1 Boba Tea, and The Windy City. Same plaza as Targets! (Btw best cake in general i've tried in my life actually)"
Simon C.,4,"Great cakes with amazing cream cheese frosting!  They sell the big cakes, mini's and bundtinis.  The buntinis are a bit over priced  IMO, but they are bite size fun cakes for parties."
David R.,4,"First time since it opened some 9 years ago. Meant to stop in and try the cake but I got side tracked. I gave them 4 stars because of price. $20.00 for a 9"" Bunt cake is just a little high.  I could see the price around $12.00 to &16.00 for a 9"" cake and that would be a high price but the quality is very good. When I walked in I was greeted by Stephine, she was helpful and offered me a sample. I ended up getting the White Chocoholic Raspberry cake. Very moist and flavorful. I will be back soon."
Enita N.,5,I think they put Crack in there cakes it's that amazing and addicting !!!! I was just driving one day stopped by and omg heaven I bought three cakes and they didn't last long lol u won't b disappointed with there cakes!!!! Going back ASAP lol
Ashley L.,5,"Amazing. Product. One the smooth delicious taste hits your palate, you will be a believer. My favorite is the pumpkin (which is unfortunately seasonal), followed closely by red velvet. Chocolate chocolate chip is amazing also. Hell, all the flavors are terrific (although carrot, lemon and praline aren't on my regular order). Soooooo good. Two locations in the valley to serve you and they deliver!"
Tina B.,5,"Oh, I LOVE this place!  It's a yummy splurge for the office!  Cakes and frosting are delicious.  In addition to just walking in and purchasing from the case, I have purchased through their website decorated cakes and even balloons.  Everything is always ready and waiting when I go to pick up.  Lots of cute decor to look through if you have guests in front of you and often samples.  :)"
Saralyn M.,5,"Oh Yummmmm!!!!!!  I've tried almost all the flavors and BY FAR the White Chocolate Raspberry is my FAVE!!!!  Go big on the frosting, don't skimp with the drizzle, the traditional has cream cheese in it which makes all the difference in the world.  Moist, delicious, an absolute treat!"
Jocelyn S.,5,"I usually don't care for bundt cakes but a co-worker swore this was one of the best desserts in vegas.  Simple....nothing bundt cakes....not much more needs to be said. Try the marble and the red velvet, haven't tried all the flavors yet...but working my way down the line. *This one gets a yum yum yuuum from me!"
Toph B.,5,"Nothing Bundt Cakes never fails to impress.  I have a bundt cake at almost every special occassion and it's always from here. I used them for gifts for loved ones and ones who I want to love me.  Over the past two years I believe they expanded and became more flexible with the cupcake craze by releasing their own reduced version of the bundt cake, the bundtlet. And by reduced, I don't mean calories. If you are here, you are fan of the indulgent and moist cake and the too die for cream cheese frosting.  They keep chocolate, marble, red velvet always in stock but if you want something like carrot, I recommend you call ahead at least 20 minutes.  Try their newest thing, the bundtinis which are little bite size pieces of bundt temptation."
EJay D.,4,At first I was like...bundt cakes?? Who the hell eats bundt cake? I went to a birthday party and had a slice...then I was hooked. I always go to this store for my constant fix for the moist and tasty goodness! Bundt cakes ar surprisingly awesome!!!!!!!
Christine G.,4,"This place is great! I've tried the marble, red velvet, pecan praline, pumpkin spice (flavor of the month).  All are really good but I'd have to say my favorite flavor is red velvet! I love how there's pieces of chocolate inside the cake! The cake itself is really moist and the cream cheese frosting is really complimentary to the cake!"
Holly P.,4,"My niece brought home a cake from Nothing Bundt Cakes her friend had got her. It was the BEST cake Ive had in a long time. It was chocolate with cream cheese frosting. At first, i thought the cake was home made because it was not overly sweet, super moist cake and the frosting tasted like it was made from scratch. Even my fiance who is not a big sweets person ate a bunch of it and LOVED it! Know where we're going next time for cakes."
Rebekah M.,5,"Always awesome...best cakes on the planet!!!  Great for coach, teacher gifts!!!  Yummy!!!"
Bernadette G.,3,Very moist cake. Just wish that there was less icing.
clifford c.,4,My wifey and I enoy Nothing Bundt Cakes  off Eastern Ave. We used to get out cakes at sandwich shops until we yelp Nothing Bundt Cakes and found there location. Yummy Yummy.
Carmen T.,5,Amazingly great bundt cakes. The kid helping me knew EVERYTHING about the bundt cake business. I'm impressed. So much so I let him upsell me to buy 2 to take home (after sampling of course). They deliver and have a rewards program as well as a free bundett for your bday if you sign up to their newsletter. I will be back.
Belle L.,5,Who knew a bundt cake could be soooo melt-in-your-mouth-and-eat-every-last-crumb good?!
Jean C.,5,I love me some red velvet bundt cakes!!! I'm not into sweets much but this is my favorite dessert for special occasions. It's light and fluffy bundts and creamy cheese frosting makes it all worth the price. I also love their marble cakes.
Jade H.,5,"These cakes are so good you wanna slap your momma.  I got the red velvet which, to my pleasant surprise, had little chocolate chips inside.  On the upside, I've never tasted a better bundt cake in my life.  On the downside, I might have started a new addiction :("
Julie L.,5,"To DIE for!  No kidding!  A little hard to find, tucked away in the Target center off Eastern south of the 215.  A couple of years ago a vendor we use in our business sent us a Bundt cake from here for Christmas - icing toothachy sweet and cake so moist and flavorful that we go there ourselves time and again - MORE than we should - we are definitely plumping up! But this is so worth it.  The shop offers tasting and cute party and cooking items for purchase as well.  I don't recommend the smaller cakes since they don't have the same cake-to-icing ratio as the larger ones, and although the cake is great, it's the icing that really makes it!  Go early, they sell out!  It's a great idea for Christmas business giving (as we found out), and it's something that will be welcome and appreciated!"
Jaymee E.,5,"I strolled in at the last second. Got a beautiful cake for my son's 16th Birthday... Nicest people, fast, and curtious!! I drove around for 30 minutes to find them, GLAD I DID!!!Anyone not give them a good review because of their prices... go to a grocery store and pick up a cake... these cakes are worth the extra $$!!"
Linda M.,5,"Been here 3 times since my birthday.  I got a flyer in the mail for a free bundtlette.   (probably spelled that wrong)  Any how, I went inside, they have free samples, they are moist, tasty, yes, you want to eat the whole cake.. It is that good.  I was given my choice of numerous flavors to taste and decided on pumpkin.  I told them it was my birthday and this was perfect as I do not ever buy myself a cake. The gentlemen behind the counter said oh, it's your birthday, then you are entitled to a free baby bundt cake, in addition to my free cake with my coupon.. I had the pecan... Yes, both were very very delicious. I will be back again soon. I love the baby cakes since they are the perfect personal size for any occasion that you want to give a personal cake to someone."
Stine D.,4,"I haven't had the chance to purchase a cake for myself but I've tried several flavors while attending birthday parties and their cakes are soooo good!  My favorite, so far, is the cinnamon cake.  I'll definitely stop by this place and get a cake for myself sooner or later."
Dijonne M.,5,"WE LOVE NOTHING BUNDT CAKES!!!!!! I have been wanting to try it out for the longest but was always too lazy to go out and get it. Finally for my birthday this past December, my husband surprised me with a dozen assorted bundtinis... They were DELICIOUS!! I've tried the Red Velvet, Marble and Chocolate... Love the Red Velvet and Chocolate! My husband tried these flavors as well as the White Chocolate Raspberry and he loves ALL OF THEM. He's actually kind of addicted to them.  Anyhow, we also bought another dozen for our in-laws just this past week and they tried Lemon and Carrot and were in heaven also. The cakes are just so damn MOIST and YUMMY! Kinda bad that this place is so close to us because now we want to buy them every week! Staff is pretty friendly... They get your order together in a timely manner with no mistakes."
Evelyn L.,4,"Always fresh, moist and delicious. My mouth is in heaven. They have a variety of flavors and perfect portions. They also have very nice party cake ideas and decor. Well worth the trip to try and buy. :)"
Kelli W.,3,Walked in to pick up a cake and there weren't any other customers. Remind me never to do that again! Took half an hour to get a freaking cake!
Gene M.,5,"Ridiculously delicious cakes!!  Seriously!!!   I just got turned onto these cakes at Easter...and again this week for a buddy's b-day!!!  Soooooo good!!!  I couldn't stop!  Had the Chocolate with Chocolate Chips.... and the Lemon..... and the white chocolate with Rasperry, I think.... all of them where great!!!"
Vincent T.,4,"First time I have ever had anything from here. A friend ordered the red velvet bundt cake with cream cheese frosting. The cake itself was delicious, but the frosting was a tad too rich for me. I can't wait to try the other cakes they make."
Blue A.,4,People are friendly and frosting is delish we got the red velvet  the cake we had was a bit dry but the frosting made up for it we served an 8 inch cake for five people and we had half the cake left! Paid $18.00 for an eight inch cake.
Alethia O.,5,"I looked in Yelp and found great reviews about it, and it didn't disappoint me, the place it is lovely, smells delicious and the cakes are really great! I bought a 10' chocolate chip cake and it was delicious. I love that they also have small personal cakes."
Erica D.,5,"So anyone who knows me know how much I LOVE cake. Birthday Cake to be precise. Nothing Bundt Cakes satisfies the birthday cake craving whenever it hits me. I like that they have ""bundtinis"" mini bunt cupcakes. And they have all different flavors and frostings. If you have never tired one, well then my friend, you are surely missing one of life's wee pleasures."
Annie P.,5,"Consistently great cakes! Ordered online. Made the mistake of setting up a wrong day for pick-up. Guess what? Not a problem. Called in, they adjusted the order and poof!! Ready by the time I requested. No problems. Friendly staff. I absolutely love the place!"
Brandon L.,5,I order from here all the time for birthdays and special events. The Chocolate Chocolate Chip and the Red Velvet Chocolate Chip are to die for!
IRish A.,5,Thank you for making the cakes & doing the drizzle style frosting that I requested for our friends' wedding.  It came so beautiful & everyone enjoyed the cakes.
Ethel C.,5,I love this place! I've been coming here for years now. I buy cakes at least once a month. My favorite is the white chocolate raspberry. I suggest being in their email list for monthly promotions like $5 off. This place is awesome. You gotta try it if you haven't yet. Highly recommended!
Heather C.,5,"Absolutely wonderful. Always a go to if you want to bring a really nice frikin amazing cake to anywhere or anyone. They are fast and THE BEST and super attentive, nice and helpful. The staff are people you feel good buying something you're going to eat from. How often does that happen in this town? Love it."
Sonia T.,4,"The best cake or my personal favorite is the pecan praline,  yum yum."
J C.,5,I have to say this place is consistent with their cakes.  I personally love the white white chocolate and the lemon.  I like to put the cake in the fridge and heat it up the next day in the micro.  It tastes like Heaven.  The bundtinis (12)  are perfect so everyone can have their own flavor.  Plus you can get a sample of the day!  They also sell white white chocolate popcorn.
Katrina S.,5,Get the red velvet or marble cake! You won't regret it. Cake is moist and frosting is very delicious. Will definitely come back! :)
Elizabeth B.,5,"Love this place! Have used them for birthdays, and even my wedding. Their cream cheese frosting is the perfect balance of tangy and sweet. Their cake is so moist while still being the right density. I love their yellow cake which is in the marble and cinnamon swirl of course.  Ok, every flavor here is great in my opinion."
Ann L.,1,I just left your place for our free birthday cupcake and was treated so poorly it was unbelievably! It was a horrible experience and if your going to treat people bad for a free Birthday cupcake than don't offer one free!
Laura A.,5,These cakes are soooo good! They never disappoint me.. same quality every time I pick them up. Extremely moist!!
Nikki N.,5,"Nothing bad to say...I'm not a cake person at all, but their chocolate, chocolate chip is brownie like and I could eat the frosting with a spoon...and the samples in the store are sooo cute...the buntinis are perfect for an office party..."
maria K.,5,Best cake ever! Always a crowd pleaser.you won't be disappointed. Not much else to say but Yelp forces me to write more.
Jessica W.,1,"Always had great service other than this time. Bought a dozen bundtinies for my dad's birthday and when I got home and unsealed the box, the platform they set the cakes in was half put together, causing all of the bundtinies to smash together and be ruined. I should've checked them before I left the store but didn't until I presented them to my dad. Very embarrassing."
Misty M.,5,"This is the best cake ever. My family received a white chocolate raspberry cake over the holidays from a neighbor. 1 week later, and it's still as moist as the first day we ate it! I definitely will recommend this delicious bakery to others!!"
Kathryn G.,5,"I live in Florida & my husband works in Vegas.  I found this bakery on Yelp & ordered the Birthday Bundt Cake with balloons to be delivered to his office on his birthday.  It was delivered just after lunch (without me even requesting a time).  He sent photos & it was just as adorable as on their website.  This is such a fun little birthday or anytime surprise.  He told me the cake was good (I ordered marble), but the frosting was sensational.  I can't wait to go back to Vegas & order one to taste myself!"
Angie L.,5,Love this place! The bundtinis are the perfect snack size. My favorite is the white white chocolate.
gail m.,5,"This place is aaaaaaawesome! If you want to be the hit of the potluck... bring in a Red Velvet Bundt. The cakes are dense, moist and have the greatest cream cheese frosting that's just a touch sweet. These bad boys make great teacher and office gifts.  My sons kindergarten teacher still remembers the cake we gave her 3 years ago.  The store is so cute with adorable accessories and gifts. The staff is super helpful and samples abound... come with an empty stomach..."
Blaire P.,5,"Someone brought a cake from here to my brother in laws birthday party. The raspberry one. It was so good people were literally fighting over the last piece. I have not been in here myself but I'm sure I will soon. The cake was moist, and the flavors strong. Would recommend."
Stacey D.,5,Big fan- tasty and not too terrible expensive to get cakes gift wrapped. The mini bundt cakes are our go to because we like to share and even one of those little ones is a lot for one person to finish..
Raven S.,5,"Their cakes are sooo yummy! We send these out for birthdays, baby showers, etc.  The cake is moist and the icing is home made, doesn't leave that after taste in your mouth like store bought cakes. If you have any kind of special event or occasion I definitely recommend that you order at least 1 day ahead; but if you forget and can call the morning of they usually try and get it there.  Definitely worth every penny!"
Fay G.,5,Love the white chocolate raspberry. Very friendly staff. The decoration on my friends bday cake was fabulous. Thanks.
Alina M.,5,Love this place!  Cakes have always been consistent....and everything I've tried have all been good.  My favorite are the red velvet cake and the white chocolate raspberry.  You cannot go wrong with any cake flavor.  They are all good!
A H.,3,The actual cake was delicious. If my review was based on that I would have given 5 stars. My issue starts with the cake not being ready when my husband went to pick it up...no big deal. Mistakes happen and they got it ready quickly. Although the getting it ready quickly may be the root of the problem. I paid the extra $10 to have it decorated and it really looked like they just threw it together. The little flags were basically laying on the cake and the cake itself was not even close to being centered. It sat to the back right corner of the cardboard. Not a huge deal but I expected more for the extra charge.
Karen S.,2,"Just spent $$90.00 and still standing here while 3 people AFTER me have left all with either wrapped or decorated. When I inquired why she says, "" oh you had two cakes "" Ummm, hello 3 cakes just walked out your door!! Just sayin'"
Marilyn L.,5,"Went to Vegas to visit my older sister for her birthday. Didn't know where to get a decent birthday cake so I decided to flip over to my handy dandy yelp app and low and behold, Nothing Bundt Cakes appeared to be one of the top rated cake shops. I was feeling indifferent between this place and another one of their competitors so I decided to go to both and give both of their samples a try. Let me just say, Nothing Bundt Cakes blew the other place out of the water. As soon as I tasted their carrot cake, I was sold! Let me tell you this, I have never had a single bite of cake that was so moist and incredibly flavorful until I stepped into this place. It was so good that (I kid you not) I was immediately saddened at the thought of leaving and not having the convenience of buying more when I was back home in San Francisco. Thank god, my sister will be visiting me soon and i've already made it a VERY annoying point for her to remember to bring me some of that good stuff!!!"
Stephanie S.,5,"Eat marble cake. No stop looking at the other flavors! Marble cake. Marble only! Wait..and white chocolate raspberry, thanks Keith almost missed that. This place is good enough that my madre ordered $1000 worth in holiday gifts of these cakes. They get pricey as you start ordering the larger ones, which you rarely need because the cake is rich and very flavorful. Unlike other cakes, it's very moist and will give you most of the flavor in the first few bites. You won't need to stuff yourself with it to be satisfied, though you will probably stuff yourself because you can't help it. I'm really waiting for one of these to move to Los Angeles and kick all the Sprinkles and other stupid bakeries out of the water. this is much better priced, and much better in general. Not ostentatious. For some reason right next to a pizza place and some discount perfume thing...weird location frankly, but you aren't going to eat the cake there so don't worry about it. You are going to eat it at home with your family and start to build an account as large as ours. By the way, they deliver, though only in four hour windows (1-4, some time in the morning too I forget) so if you need it at a specific time just make the effort to pick it up. Ah bundt cake, I love thee so much."
Janelle T.,4,The White chocolate raspberry is heaven! I've ordered it twice already. I'm just too scared other flavours won't live up to it.
Jen N.,5,"my cousins told me about this and im really glad they did.  so moist and good, but i suggest the drizzle icing..just the right amount!"
Cory S.,5,Very friendly and helpful staff.  The prices are just right and their cakes always make people happy!  You cannot go wrong with any of the choices and the offer samples!
S P.,5,"Yum! Have tried red velvet, marble, choc choc chip, pumpkin, raspberry swirl. Always a hit with guests and great to bring for a gathering!"
Piss D.,5,"First time having a NBC! I had chocolate chip, it was soft, moist, rich and delicious!! Jennifer took care of me and went above and beyond. NBC definitely won me as a new customer. Thank you Jennifer for the kindness and for going out of your ways to take care of me :)"
Iris O.,4,"So, I love cake and so does my husband.  This culmination of pastry meets heaven is utterly yum, however in my recent visits I've noticed that the frosting is relatively thiner and thus I am forced to pay an extra $5.00 for additional frosting to satisfy my husbands taste buds.  Owners if your out there, please go back to quality vs. quantity."
Esraa M.,4,"Chocolate-chip red valet cake, absolutely amazing, I love their frosting its very tasty and I feel it's not as heavy like any other frostings on other cakes. I'm a big fan of their cakes."
